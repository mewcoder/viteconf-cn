13
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,733
这里有一个来自previewjs com的快速预览。
so here's a very quick preview from previewjs com

14
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,733
这里有一个来自previewjs com的快速预览。
so here's a very quick preview from previewjs com

15
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:27,833
但我将会
but I'm going to be

16
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,599
但我还会再来看看
but i'm going to be coming back to it

17
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,033
回来的时候，有一个稍微详细的
coming back to it with a slightly more detailed

18
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,666
与一个稍微更详细的概述
with a slightly more detailed overview

19
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:30,833
概述
overview

20
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,999
首先，我将谈论我为什么要建立它
at first i'm going to talk about why i built it

21
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,033
首先，我要谈一谈我为什么要建立它
at first I'm going to talk about why I build it

22
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,100
以及它如何融入其中
and how it fits into it

23
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,133
以及它是如何融入其中的
and how it fits into it

24
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,933
以及它是如何使其成为可能的，首先
and how it makes it possible in the first place

25
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,933
以及它是如何在第一时间使之成为可能的
and how it makes it possible in the first place

26
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,733
因此，让我们从创建一个反应式应用程序开始
so let's start by creating a react app

27
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,733
所以让我们从创建一个react应用开始
so let's start by creating a react app

28
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,399
我以react为例
and i'm using react as an example

29
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,433
我以react为例
and I'm using react as an example

30
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,099
但它也能与视图和实体一起工作
but it also works with view and solid

31
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:46,899
但它也适用于视图和实体，所以yarn创建react应用
but it also works with view and solid so yarn create react app

32
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,900
所以yarn创建反应式应用程序
so yarn create react app

33
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,100
食物
food

34
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,666
安装软件包
installing packages

35
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,399
安装软件包 这可能需要几分钟的时间
installing packages this might take a couple of minutes

36
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,366
这可能需要几分钟的时间
this might take a couple of minutes

37
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,700
我没有几分钟的时间了，我要停止这一切。
i do not have a couple of minutes i'm gonna stop that

38
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:54,866
我没有几分钟的时间
I do not have a couple of minutes

39
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:55,700
我要停止这一切
I'm gonna stop that

40
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,766
而不是
and instead of

41
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,199
yarn我将使用pnpm
yarn i'm gonna use pnpm

42
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,766
我要用pnpm来代替yarn，这样会快一点
yarn I'm gonna use pnpm which is a little bit faster

43
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,800
这是一个小的速度
which is a little bit faster

44
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,600
它实际上是什么维生素现在使用
it's actually what vit uses nowadays

45
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,633
它实际上是维生素现在使用的东西
it's actually what vit uses nowadays

46
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:04,299
而不是
and instead of

47
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:04,300
而不是
and instead of

48
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,599
创建机架式应用，我会使用创建维生素，因为
create racked app i'm gonna be using create vit because well

49
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,333
创建反应应用程序，我会使用创建维生素，因为
create react app I'm gonna be using creat vit because

50
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,099
因为这是Vitcom，所以
well this is vitcom right so

51
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,133
这就是vitcom，对吗？
this is vitcom right so

52
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,099
为什么不在PNPM上创建Vit
why not pnpm create vit

53
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,133
为什么不采用PNP创建Vit
why not pnpm create vit

54
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,499
这是什么，这是超级快的我的签证应用程序
and this is what this is super fast my visa app

55
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,499
这就是我的视频应用，这就是超级快的视频应用。
and this is what this is super fast my video app

56
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:20,499
完善的反应脚本
react abscript perfect

57
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:20,499
我的视频应用
react appscript perfect

58
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,133
pmpm store
pmpm store

59
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,166
pmpm安装
pmpm install

60
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,166
嗯呢
嗯呢

61
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:24,933
和
and

62
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,166
我们做得很好

63
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,166
我们已经完成了
we're done cool

64
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,666
所以现在
so now

65
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,300
所以，现在我们有了这个美丽的代码库，已经
so now we have this beautiful code base that has been

66
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,866
我们有这个美丽的代码库，一直在自动
we have this beautiful code base that has been automatically

67
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
自动排出的
automatically draining

68
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,366
为我们生成的
draining generated for us

69
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,366
为我们生成的
generated for us

70
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,733
而它的代码是美丽的
and it's the code is beautiful

71
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,733
它的代码是美丽的，它的代码是美丽的
and it's the code is beautiful

72
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,733
但实际的应用程序也很美
but the actual app is beautiful as well

73
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,866
所以让我们进去运行它
so let's go in run it

74
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:41,899
所以，让我们去运行它，让我们去piang piang。

00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:53,566
更重要的是，看看视频标志上的悬停效果
more importantly look at the hover effects on the vid logo

84
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:50,100
更重要的是

90
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:59,366
反应的标志，但维生素的标志是更花哨的
the react logo but the vit logo is even more fancy

91
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,566
我认为有人花了很多时间来调整这个
i think someone spent a lot of time tweaking this

92
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,566
我认为有人花了很多时间来调整这个
I think someone spent a lot of time tweaking this

93
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:02,566
并使它只是
and making it just

94
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:02,566
并使它只是
and making it just

95
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,300
完美的火花，无论如何

97
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,433
总之，所以
anyway so

98
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,733
所以我们有这个计数器，这不是用来演示的。
so we have this counter and this is this is not for demo

99
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,700
我们有这个计数器，这不是用于演示的。
we have this counter and this is this is not for demo

100
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,366
我们要做的是
what we're gonna do is

101
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,366
我们要做的是
what we're gonna do is

102
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,499
当你点击计数器的次数过多时
when you click the counter too many times

103
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,500
当你点击计数器的次数过多时
when you click the counter too many times

104
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,866
比方说15次
let's say fifteen times

105
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,866
比方说，15次
let's say 15 times

106
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,400
我们将显示一个警告信息，告诉你，嘿
we're gonna show a warning message that tells you hey

107
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,433
我们将显示一个警告信息，告诉你，嘿
we're gonna show a warning message that tells you hey

108
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:21,166
也许是时候考虑做别的事情了
it's maybe time to think about doing something else

109
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:21,166
也许是时候考虑做一些其他的事情了
it's maybe time to think about doing something else

110
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,199
然后点击按钮
then clicking the button

111
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,233
然后点击该按钮
then clicking the button

112
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:23,433
所以
so

113
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,500
所以
so

114
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,366
让我们在这里说，数到15以上的时候
let's go in here and say count more than 15

115
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,366
让我们在这里说，计数超过15个
let's go in here and say counts more than fifteen

116
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,166
我说我说超过15
I said I said more than 15

117
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:30,699
我说我说超过15 是的，所以
i said i said more than fifteen yeah so

118
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,666
是的，所以
yeah so

119
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:32,233

英国这个
uk this

125
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:37,666
太多次了
too many times

126
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:39,166
太多次了，该停下来了
too many times time to stop

127
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,133
是时候停下来了
time to stop

128
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,000
如果我回到我的兄弟身边，当然
and if i go back to my brother of course

129
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,366
如果我回到我哥哥身边
and if I go back to my brother

130
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,933
当然，因为计数是15，它的出现
of course because the count is 15 it's appearing

131
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,566
因为数到15它就出现了 但如果我
because the count is fifteen it's appearing but if i

132
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,533
但如果我的新鲜声音还没有出现的话
but if I fresh voice is not appearing yet

133
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,566
新鲜的声音还没有出现
fresh voice is not appearing yet

134
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,333
所以，我点击了一堆倍，是有
so I click a bunch of times and is there

135
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,333
因此，我点击了一堆倍，是有
so i click a bunch of times and is there

136
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
现在
now

137
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:52,866
现在
now

138
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:56,300
比方说，我想吃这个警告元素的速率
let's say I want to eat rate on this warning element

139
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,200
让我们说我想在这个警告元素上吃率
let's say i want to eat rate on this warning

140
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,466
元素，我想把它变成红色或类似的东西。
element i want to make it maybe red or something like that well

141
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,233

I want to make it maybe red or something like that

142
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,333
首先，我需要多次点击这个。
well first I need to click this a bunch of times

143
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:02,599
首先，我需要多次点击这个来显示它
first i need to click this a bunch of times to show it

144
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:04,533
以显示它，然后我就可以对它进行处理了
to show it and then I can work on it

145
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,533
然后我就可以开始工作了
and then i can work on it

146
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,733
但你可能以前也遇到过这种情况
but you've probably been in the situation before

147
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,766
但你可能已经在之前的情况下
but you've probably been in the situation before

148
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,033
在现实生活中
where in real life

149
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,166
在现实生活中，当你在建设网站时
where in real life when you're building website

150
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,766
当你在建立网站时，你有这些
when you're building website you have these

151
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:10,799
你有这些
you have these

152
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,333
组件，这些UI元素只出现在像
components these ui elements that only appear in like

153
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,233
组件 这些UI元素
components these UI elements

154
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,833
只有在非常特殊的情况下才会出现
that only appear in like very specific conditions

155
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,266
非常特殊的情况下，比如你是一个管理员或
very specific conditions like when you're an admin or

156
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,266
比如当你是一个管理员或
like when you're an admin or

157
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,099
当你有一个特定的废墟时
when you have a specific ruin

158
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,100
当你有一个特定的废墟时，被设置的数据库
when you have a specific ruin the database that is set

159
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,200
遗憾的是，设置的数据库
the database that is set and unfortunately

160
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,233
和不幸的是
and unfortunately

161
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
你的测试数据库没有这个规则
your test database doesn't have that rule

162
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,166
你的测试数据库没有这个规则
your test database doesn't have that rule

163
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,133
所以你需要模拟它
so you need to mock it

164
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,500
所以你需要以某种方式来模拟它
so you need to mock it somehow

165
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:23,933
某种程度上，等等
somehow etc

166
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,300
等等
etc

167
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,099
而在这里，我们可以做的是，我们可以把它砍掉。
and and here what we can do is we can just hack it around

168
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,099
在这里，我们可以做的是，我们可以随便黑掉它。
and here what we can do is we can just hack it around

169
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,266
所以我们基本上可以改变这里的主要入口点
so we can basically change the main entry point here

170
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,300
为警告
to be the warning

171
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,233
改为警告组件。
to be the warning component instead

172
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,200
组件来代替
component instead

173
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,866
而这是超级黑客的做法
and this is super hacky

174
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:34,366
而这是超级黑客的做法，让我们不要
and this is super hacky let's not

175
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,233
我们不会真的这样做，但
we're not gonna actually do this but

176
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,333
我们不会真的这样做，但只是为了向你展示这个想法
we're not gonna actually do this but just to show you the idea

177
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,299
只是为了向你展示
just to show you

178
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,333
这个想法
the idea

179
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,933
让我们来做这个吧
let's let's do that

180
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,300
让我们这样做，让我们把这个导出为组件
let's let's do that so let's export this as components

181
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,299
所以让我们把这个导出为组件
so let's export this as components

182
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,699
然后在这里我们要做警告
and then here we're gonna do warning

183
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,666
然后在这里，我们要做警告
and then here we're gonna do warning

184
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
然后回到我的浏览器上
and back to my browser

185
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,733
我看到的是 "无限的"（discomfinite）。
i can see just discomfinite

186
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,733
我可以看到只有discomfinite
I can see just discomfinite

187
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:51,166
这意味着
which means that

188
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:51,333
这意味着，现在
which means that now

189
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,100
现在我不需要多次点击计数器了
now I don't need to click the counter a bunch of times

190
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,099
我不需要点击计数器很多次
i don't need to click the counter a bunch of times

191
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,933
来看到它出现
to see it appear

192
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,933
或类似的东西
or anything like that

193
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,100
我也可以把它与我的 "我的 "并排放在一起。
I can also just put that side by side with

194
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,366
我也可以把它和我的ID并排放在一起。
i can also just put that side by side with my

195
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:03,299
我的ID可以很好地看到它的出现
my id to see it appear nicely

196
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,300
我也可以把它和我的名字放在一起，让它看起来很好。
id to see it appear nicely

197
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:06,766
你知道，现在我可以进入应用程序的css
and you know now i can go into app that css

198
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:06,766
而你知道现在我可以进入应用的CSS
and you know now I can go into app that CSS

199
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,033
并让我们说
and let's say

200
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,066
和让我们说
and let's say

201
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,400
所以这是警告
so this is warning

202
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,466
所以这是警告
so this is warning

203
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,366
颜色为红色
color red

204
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,366
红色
color red

205
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,133
酷
cool

206
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,333
现在，这是一个可怕的想法，因为
now this is a terrible idea because

207
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,666
现在，这是一个可怕的想法，因为如果有任何机会，错误地
now this is a terrible idea because if by any chance by mistake

208
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,833
如果通过任何改变
if by any change

209
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,133
错了，你最终会把这个变化并入缅因州
by mistake you end up merging this change into Maine

210
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,133
你最终会把这个改动合并到缅因州的
you end up merging this change into maine

211
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,899
到被部署的主分支中去
into the main branch that gets deployed

212
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,900
到被部署的主分支中去
into the main branch that gets deployed

213
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,933
那么显然
then obviously

214
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,766
你的用户会有
your users are gonna have

215
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,966
你的用户会有一个完全破碎的体验
your users are gonna have a completely broken experience

216
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,966
一个完全破碎的体验
a completely broken experience

217
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,099
因为他们所看到的
because all they're gonna see

218
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,166
因为他们所看到的是那个组件
because all they're gonna see is that component

219
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,166
是那个组件
is that component

220
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,366
而不是应该看到的应用
as opposed to the app that is supposed to see

221
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,766
相对于应该看到的应用程序，所以
as opposed to the app that is supposed to see so

222
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,533
因此，让我们把这个和
so let's refer this and

223
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,533
让我们把它变成这样，然后
let's refer it this and

224
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,299
让它回到它应该是的样子
get it back to what it's supposed to be

225
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:36,333
让它回到它应该有的状态
get it back to what it's supposed to be

226
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:41,266
并找到另一个解决方案，所以我打算把这个藏起来
and find another solution instead so i'm gonna hide this

227
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,666
并找到另一个解决方案来代替
and find another solution instead

228
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,233
所以我要把它藏起来
so I'm gonna hide this

229
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,266
我打算停止开发，所以我实际上不需要这个。
I'm going to stop the devs so I don't actually

230
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,266
我打算停止开发，所以我实际上不需要这个了
i'm going to stop the devs so i don't actually need this anymore

231
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,266
不再需要这个
need this anymore

232
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,366
而我将使用特权S
and instead I'm going to use privilege s

233
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,866
取而代之的是我要使用特权S，所以
and instead i'm going to use privilege s so

234
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:53,733
所以现在我们可以回去添加tsx，我已经有了
so now we can go back to add tsx and I already have

235
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,733
现在我们可以回到添加tsx，而且我已经有了
now we can go back to add tsx and i already have

236
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,599
特权S安装在这里
privilege s installed here

237
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,633
特权S安装在这里
privage s installed here

238
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,666
这对VASCO基地来说是可用的
and this is available for vasco base

239
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,666
而这是可以用于VASCO基地的
and this is available for vasco base

240
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,533
也适用于智能网店
also for intelligent web store

241
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,500
也适用于英特尔-简网络商店
also for Intel a Jane web store

242
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,766
现在我可以看到，我有这个
and now i can see that i have this

243
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,766
现在我可以看到，我有这个
and now I can see that I have this

244
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:08,199
链接在每个组件的顶部，所以在特权S中打开应用程序
link on top of each of the components so open app in privilege s

245
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,033
链接在每一个信心的顶部
link on top of each of the confidence

246
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,233
因此，在特权S中打开应用程序
so open app in privilege s

247
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,300
或在这里在特权S中打开警告
or here open warning in privilege s

248
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,299
或在这里在特权S中打开警告
or here open warning in privilege s

249
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,100
如果我打开并预先拒绝
if i open up and pre reject

250
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,099
如果我打开并预先拒绝
if I open up and pre reject

251
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,033
它要做的就是把它并排打开
what it's going to do is open it side by side

252
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,866
它要做的是在我的ID中并排打开它
what it's going to do is open it side by side within my id

253
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,833
在我的ID内，所以这就像在与代码
within my id so this is like within vs code

254
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,799
所以这就像在VS代码中一样
so this is like within vs code

255
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,100
如果我打开
and if I open

256
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,766
如果我打开警告，它就会向我显示那个自信的
and if i open warning it will show me just that confident

257
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,733
警告，它就会向我显示那个组件
warning it will show me just that component

258
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,700
所以这意味着你可以使用这个
so that means that you can use that

259
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,733
所以这意味着你可以用它来
so that means that you can use that

260
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
来测试任何隔离的组件
to test any component in isolation

261
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:27,466
来测试你想要的任何组件。
to test any component in isolation that you want

262
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,500
你想要的
that you want

263
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,733
而不是必须
as opposed to having to

264
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,066
而不是围绕着不同的
as opposed to having to hack around the

265
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
围绕着不同的
hack around the different

266
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,933
不同的入口点或类似的东西
different the entry point or anything like that

267
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,933
入口点或任何类似的东西
the entry point or anything like that

268
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,566
在引擎盖下的特权正在做什么
under the hood what privileges is doing

269
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,366
在引擎盖下
under the hood

270
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,900
特权是什么做的是它的那种模拟
what privileges is doing is it's kind of simulating

271
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:38,266
是它的那种模拟一个假的入口点
is it's kind of simulating a fake entry point

272
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,266
一个假的进入点
a fake entry point

273
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,733
恰恰是在做黑客攻击你的事
doing precisely the hack that does strude you

274
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,733
恰恰是做了黑客，确实只是给你看
doing precisely the hack that does just show you

275
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:41,666
但
but

276
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,533
但是，在内存中的方式，不乱用你的文件
but in memory in a way that doesn't mess with your files

277
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,533
在内存中的方式，不乱用你的文件
in memory in a way that doesn't mess with your files

278
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
所以现在我可以
so now I can

279
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,800
所以，现在我可以调整这个有点
so now i can tweak this a bit

280
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,833
调整一下
tweak this a bit

281
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,333
可以调整这个
can tweak this

282
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,166
可以稍微调整一下
can tweak this a little

283
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,866
一点点
little bit

284
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,100
一点
bit

285
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,200
你可以看到，它实际上是作为一个类型来更新的
and you can see that it's actually updating as a type

286
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,233
你可以看到它实际上是作为一个类型来更新的
and you can see that it's actually updating as a type

287
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,200
这比起要等到我保存时才更新要好得多。
which is slightly nicer than having to wait until i save

288
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,166
这比要等到我保存
which is slightly

289
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,166
比要等到我保存时才更新要好一些
nicer than having to wait until I save

290
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,900
这是可能的，由于维生素的支持的插件
and this is possible thanks to vit's support for plugins

291
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,333
和这是可能的，由于
and this is possible thanks to

292
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,933
维特对插件的支持
vit's support for plugins

293
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,666
因此，一个特权当然是由维生素提供动力，否则
so a privileges of course is powered by vit otherwise

294
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,299
因此，特权当然是由维生素提供的
so the privileges of course is powered by vit

295
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,366
否则，我不会谈论它在VIDCOFF
otherwise I wouldn't be talking about it at vidcoff

296
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,366
我不会谈论它在vitcoff的
i wouldn't be talking about it at vitcoff

297
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,066
但维生素有这个真正强大的生态系统的插件
but vit has this really powerful ecosystem of plugins

298
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,333
但维生素有这个真正的
but vit has this really

299
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,100
强大的生态系统的插件
powerful ecosystem of plugins

300
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,766
这是在滚筒插件的基础上
which are based on roller plugins

301
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,733
这是以滚筒插件为基础的
which are based on roller plugins

302
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,500
而且你可以实现
and you can implement

303
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,066
你可以实现像一个虚拟农场系统
and you can implement like a virtual far system

304
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,300
像一个虚拟文件系统，即使你想
like a virtual file system even if you want to

305
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,299
即使你想
even if you want to

306
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,466
所以在这种情况下
so in this case

307
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,666
所以在这种情况下，其中一个我正在打字
so in this case one of them I'm typing

308
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:20,266
其中之一，我打字的每一个键程，我正在做的
one of them i'm typing on every key stroke that i'm making

309
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,266
在我做的每一个按键上
on every key stroke that I'm making

310
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:24,433
它告诉我，这个虚拟文件已经改变了
it's telling that hey this virtual file has changed

311
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,000
它正在处理嘿
it's dealing with hey

312
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,600
这个虚拟文件已经改变了 现在刷新它
this virtual file has changed now refresh it

313
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:25,566
现在刷新它
now refresh it

314
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,133
这就是这里发生的事情，因为这个维生素是如此之快
and that's what is happening here because this vit is so fast

315
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,433
这就是发生在这里的事情
and that's what is happening here

316
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:30,299
因为如果它是如此之快，你实际上并没有看到
because if it is so fast you don't actually see

317
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:33,166
你实际上没有看到任何滞后之间的我打它和
you don't actually see any lag between me typing it and the

318
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,233
任何滞后，我打字和
any lag between me typing it and the

319
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,366
实际发生的变化
actual changes happening

320
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,366
实际发生的变化
actual changes happening

321
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,566
这就是
this is

322
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,566
这就是
this is

323
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,233
几乎是
pretty much

324
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,199
幾乎是
pretty much

325
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,033
譬喻
instance

326
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,100
譬喻
instance

327
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,000
现在
now

328
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,100
现在
now

329
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,166
我们现在所看到的组件
the the components that we're looking at right now

330
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,166
我们现在所看到的组件
the components that we're looking at right now

331
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,299
是超级简单的
are super simple

332
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,300
是超级简单的
are super simple

333
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:47,299
它们基本上是
they're basically the

334
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:47,300
它们基本上是
they're basically the

335
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,700
UI组件的常量
constants of UI components

336
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,099
UI自信的常量，因为它们不需要任何道具
constants of ui confidence because they don't take any props

337
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,100
因为它们不需要任何道具
because they don't take any props

338
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,733
但是，这个......这个需要这个
but this this takes this

339
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,133
但这个让我们做一些更现实的事情吧
but this let's do something a little bit more realistic

340
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,133
做点更现实的事情
do something a little bit more realistic

341
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,866
让我们说，警告组件实际上
let's say the warning component actually

342
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:56,199
让我们说，警告组件实际上需要一个信息
let's say the warning component actually takes a message

343
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,233
采取一个信息
takes a message

344
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,966
和一个非点击
and a non click

345
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,899
和一个点击时
and an on click

346
00:06:59,066 --> 00:06:59,866
倾听者
listener

347
00:06:59,066 --> 00:06:59,866
倾听者
listener

348
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,866
所以我们不点击等于抓取明星点击
so we don't click equals grab star click

349
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,866
所以我们要做的是，点击等同于道具唐纳德点击
so we do on click equals props Donald click

350
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,500
也许我现在应该为gidhabota试点付钱了
maybe i should pay for gidhabota pilot now

351
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,499
也许我现在应该为github的试点付钱了
maybe I should pay for github to pilot now

352
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,733
道具点信息
props dot message

353
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,733
probstad消息
probstad message

354
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,000
好的
okay

355
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,033
好的
okay

356
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,666
顶级脚本编译器的API是在引擎盖下使用的
the top script compiler api is used under the hood

357
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,166
顶级脚本编译器的API是
the top script compiler API is

358
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:17,666
在引擎盖下使用
used under the hood

359
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:18,466
以
to

360
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,866
来自动检测
to automatically detect

361
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:23,099
自动检测组件的道具是什么，所以如果我
automatically detect what are the props of the component so if i

362
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,466
组件的道具是什么？
what are the props of the component

363
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,266
那么，如果我
so if I

364
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,300
点击这个
click on this

365
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,766
点击这个，它就会自动生成
click on this it's going to automatically generate

366
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,000
它将自动生成消息
it's going to automatically generate message

367
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:29,133
消息，这是一个有效的属性值
message which is a valid value for properties

368
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,133
这是一个有效的属性值
which is a valid value for properties

369
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,499
而且它实际上并不
and it doesn't actually

370
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,499
而且它实际上并不
and it doesn't actually

371
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,733
显示给你看，但在引擎盖下有一个点击监听器正在
show you but under the hood is an on click listener being

372
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,233
显示你
show you

373
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,733
但在引擎盖下是一个点击监听器被生成
but under the hood is an on click listener being

374
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,966
生成，如果我点击这个
generated as well if I click on this

375
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,000
生成，如果我点击这个
generated as well if i click on this

376
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,633
你可以看到这个弹出函数被打破了
you can see this pop up function proping broke

377
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,766
你可以看到这个弹出式函数被调用了
you can see this pop up function prop invoked

378
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:41,733
而且每次我点击它的时候
and like every time i click it

379
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:41,733
和每次我点击它
and every time I click it

380
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:42,866
让我告诉你
let me show you

381
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,066
稍微高级一些的组件
slightly more advanced components

382
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
更高级的组件
slightly more advanced components

383
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:49,899
来说明一下，这里有这个按钮组件
to to illustrate so here have this button component

384
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,700
来说明
to illustrate

385
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,900
所以这里有这个按钮组件
so here have this button component

386
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,933
它当然也需要子代
and it takes children of course

387
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,933
它当然也需要子代
and it takes children of course

388
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,566
类型大小和取消点击和
type size and unclick and

389
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,933
类型大小和点击
type size and on click

390
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,833
这里的类型实际上是3个值中的一个，对吗？
and here type is actually one of 3 values right

391
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,266
这里
here

392
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,799
类型实际上是三个值中的一个，对吗？
type is actually one of three values right

393
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:01,533
要么成功，要么错误，要么透明
either success error or transparent

394
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,733
当我打开这个
when i open this

395
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,733
当我打开这个的时候
when I open this

396
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,533
它就会生成一个非常简单的
it's just going to generate a very very simple

397
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,499
它只是要生成一个非常非常简单的
it's just gonna generate a very very simple

398
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:07,666
的版本
version of it

399
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,766
我实际上可以生成它的版本
version of it i can actually generate

400
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,766
我实际上可以生成
I can actually generate

401
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,966
道具的随机值，就像这样
random values for the props like this

402
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,966
为道具生成的随机值是这样的
random values for the props like this

403
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:16,399
而且我还可以使用其他的完成方式，所以如果我这样做的话
and i can also just use the other completes so if i do

404
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:16,433
我也可以使用自动完成，所以如果我做了
and I can also just use the auto complete so if I do

405
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,600
类型
type

406
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,633
类型
type

407
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,266
我实际上有
I actually have

408
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,266
我实际上可以在这些不同的值之间进行选择
i actually have the choice between these different values

409
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,233
在这些不同的值之间进行选择
the choice between these different values

410
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
现在，这是免费版本的特权
now this is the free version of privileges

411
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:25,066
现在，这是免费版本的特权，这是
now this is the free version of privileges which is

412
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,266
这是免费和开放源码的
which is free and open source

413
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,266
免费和开源的
free and open source

414
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,366
也有一个付费的专业版本
there is also a pro version that is paid

415
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:31,066
而我们的想法是，最好是补贴
and the idea is to ideally subsidize

416
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:31,066
和想法是理想的补贴
and the idea is to ideally subsidize

417
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,733
补贴特权项目，这样我就可以花费
the privileges project so that i can spend

418
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,733
资助特权项目，这样我就可以把大部分时间花在
the privileges project so that I can spend

419

435
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,900
这是基于代码的
which is code based

436
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,966
我可以更新 我可以像这样添加任何可选的值

可以在不同的值之间进行选择
between the different values that are available

443
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,699
顺便说一句，像道具编辑器可以支持任何
and by the way like the props editor can support any

444
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,666
类型的复杂性时

446
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,100
你知道嵌套类型数组或所有这类东西吗？
you know nested types arrays or all this kind of stuff

447
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,099
你知道嵌套类型数组或所有这类东西
you know nested types arrays or all this kind of stuff

448
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,500

451
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,999
我愿意花钱购买私人的JS专业版
i'd pay for private js pro

452
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,966
我愿意为私人js pro付费
I'd pay for a private js pro

453
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:19,666
但除此之外，我希望大多数人将
but otherwise i'm hoping that most people will

454
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:19,666
但除此之外，我希望大多数人都能

能够过得很好
be able to get get by fine

456
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,266
能够得到告别
be able to get goodbye

457
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,566
只用事先的js就可以了，而不必为它付费
fine with just prior js without having to pay for it

458
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,566
只用私人的js而不用付钱
with just private js without having to pay for it

459
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,666
因此，这将使其失去作用。
so this disable back

460
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,699
所以这就不能再使用了
so this disable back

461
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,266
亲
pro

462
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,266
亲
pro

463
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,733
而现在
and now

464
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,133
现在让我告诉你，它也可以在视图中工作。
and now let me just show you that it does work with view as well

465
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,766
让我告诉你，它确实与视图一起工作
let me just show you that it does work with view

466
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:32,733
也是如此，我
as well I

467
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,166
我它也能与实体一起工作
i it works with solid as well

468
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,166
它也能和实体一起工作
it works with solid as well

469
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,333
但我们没有时间去做所有的事情，所以
but i we don't have time for everything so

470
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,866
但我没有时间去做所有的事情
but I we don't have time for everything

471
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,233
所以让我们去创建另一个应用程序
so let's go and create another app

472
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,200
让我们去创建另一个应用程序
let's go and create another app

473
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,200
这将是一个视图应用程序
which is gonna be a view app

474
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,233
这将是一个视图应用程序
which is going to be a view app

475
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,033
我的视图应用程序
my view app

476
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,066
我的视图应用程序
my view app

477
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,066
这是一个伟大的应用程序名称，我认为没有反应，嘿嘿，坏习惯。
that's a great app name i think no not react hehe bad habits

478
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,366
这是一个伟大的应用程序的名字，我认为
that's a great app name I think

479
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,133
不
no

480
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,066
没有反应的坏习惯
not react bad habits

481
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:51,099
因此，重新开始我的视图应用程序
so start again my view app

482
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,866
视图标签脚本
view tab script

483
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,866
视图描述
view descript

484
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,099
我将会安装依赖性文件
and i'm gonna install the depenses

485
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,966
我要安装依赖性的东西
and I'm going to install the dependencies

486
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,033
是的
yeah

487
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,066
好的
yep

488
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,733
现在我将打开它
and now I'm gonna open that

489
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:04,733
现在我要打开它
and now i'm gonna open that

490
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:07,966
好的
okay

491
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:07,966
好的
okay

492
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:11,299
而不是jsx，因为这是一个视图应用程序。
instead of jsx of course because this is a view app

493
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,299
而不是jsx，因为这是一个视图应用程序
instead of jsx of course because this is a view app

494
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,133
我们将有这个视图文件
we're going to have this view files

495
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,133
我们将有这样的视图文件
we're going to have this view files

496
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,700
但它的工作方式是完全一样的
but the way it works is pretty much exactly the same

497
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,100
所以我们在顶部有这个链接
so we have this link at the top

498
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
在权限中打开应用程序

so you know you can look at the default

696
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,066
证明故事、成功故事、空中故事等

703
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,800
就像这样

704
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,833
就像这样
just like that

705
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,766
这是我认为相当不错的
which is i think pretty cool

706
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,766
这是我认为非常酷的
which is I think pretty cool

707
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,400
你可以
you could

708
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,433
你可以
you could

709
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,933
你可以再进一步，实际上如果你想
take it one step further and actually if you wanted to

710
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:41,933
更进一步，实际上如果你想
take it one step further and actually if you wanted to

711
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,700
只是
just

712
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,566
就能看到你所有的故事书
just see all of your storybook

713
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,533
看到你的所有故事书
see all of your storybook

714
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,766
有
there is

715
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,466
有一个功能，我一直在研究
there is a feature that i've been working on

716
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,166
我一直在研究的一个功能，是尚未
a feature that I've been working on that is not yet

717
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,199
还没有上线，虽然到时候
that is not yet live although by the time

718
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,766
虽然到了股票上市的时候
live although by the time the stock comes

719
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,066
证券来了，也许这将是生活
the stock comes that maybe it will be life

720
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,066
也许它将成为生命
that maybe it will be life

721
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,099
这就是Cli Virgin privilege's，可以让你
which is the cli virgin privilege s that lets you

722
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,933
看到你所有的故事
see all of your stories

723
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,933
看到你所有的故事
see all of your stories

724
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:00,266
我想要的一切，所以让我进入这里
all i want so let me go into here

725
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:00,266
我想要的一切，所以让我进入这里
all I want so let me go into here

726
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,866
我在cli中，所以我要做pnpm开发。
and i'm in the cli so i'm gonna do pnpm dev

727
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,833
我在cli中，所以我要做pnpm开发。
and I'm in the cli so I'm gonna do pnpm dev

728
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,000
饥饿
hungry

729
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,033
饥饿
hungry

730
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,333
所以这是开发版本的权限
so this is the dev version of privileges

731
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,333
所以这是特权的开发版本
so this is the dev version of privileges

732
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,766
这可能有一些错误
which probably has a few bugs

733
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:16,199
是的，因为我运行了错误的命令，开发社区。
yes it does because i ran the wrong command dev community

734
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:13,166
是的，它是的，因为我
yes it does because I

735
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:14,966
运行了错误的命令
ran the wrong command

736
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,266
开发社区
dev community

737
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:17,866
这应该是更好的
that should be better

738
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:17,866
这应该是更好的
that should be better

739
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,100
好了，在这里你可以看到，我
okay so here you can see that i

740
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,666
好的，所以在这里
okay so here

741
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,666
你可以看到，我可以预览任何组件
you can see that I can preview any of the components

742
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,666
可以预览任何组件
can preview any of the components

743
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,266
就像这样，这里有一个初始
just like that there is an initial

744
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,366
就像这样
just like that

745
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:27,100
有一个最初的加载时间，但之后是
there is an initial load time but after that is

746
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,400
但之后的加载时间就相当快了
load time but after that is pretty fast

747
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:28,433
相当快
pretty fast

748
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,166
是的
yeah

749
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,200
是的
yeah

750
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,733
当然，如果你更新文件
and of course if you update the file

751
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,299
你知道它将在这里即时更新
you know it will update here instantly

752
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,266
你知道它将在这里即时更新
you know it will update here instantly

753
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,566
我不仅可以显示这些故事
i can also not only show the stories

754
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,566
我也可以不只显示故事
I can also not only show the stories

755
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:40,133
但如果我点击显示组件
but if i click show components

756
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:41,266
但如果我点击显示组件，我可以显示
but if I click show components I can show

757
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,299
我可以显示
i can show

758
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,333
我可以单独显示任何组件
any component individually

759
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,933
所以这里有一个按钮，我们之前已经看到了
so here have the button that we've seen earlier

760
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,300
在这里我有
where i have

761
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,933
在这里我可以
where I have I can

762
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:51,866
我可以改变大小，并以我想要的方式预览它
i can change the size and just preview it however i want

763
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,900
改变大小，并以我想要的方式进行预览
change the size and just preview it however I want

764
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:53,499
下一件事
the next thing

765
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:54,566
下一件事，我即将建立
the next thing I'm about to build

766
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,566
我正准备建造
i'm about to build

767
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:56,333
这可能只在专业版中出现。
this is probably going to be only in the pro version

768
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:56,733
这可能只在专业版中出现，但
this is probably gonna be only in the pro version but

769
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,733
但你将会有保存的功能
but you're going to have the save

770
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,466
你将会有这个
you're gonna have this

771
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,866
保存按钮，让你创建一个新的故事
save button that lets you create a new story

772
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,866
按钮，让你创建一个新的故事
button that lets you create a new story

773
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,299
或者如果你正在查看一个特定的故事
or if you're viewing a specific story

774
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,266
或者如果你正在浏览一个特定的故事
or if you're viewing a specific story

775
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,533
你就可以将道具连接起来
you can twig the props

776
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:06,366
你可以将道具连接起来，然后点击保存并添加到故事中。
you can twig the props and just hit save and add that story so

777
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,899
然后点击保存并添加该故事
and there's just hit save and add that story

778
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,233
因此，这个想法是，你不需要
so the idea being that you don't need to

779
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,200
这个想法是，你不需要
the idea being that you don't need to

780
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,800
真正处理的故事文件，将手动了
really deal with stories files that will manually anymore

781
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,733
真正处理的故事文件，
really deal with stories files that

782
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:11,766
愿意手动处理
will manually anymore

783
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:13,666
所有你做的是你使用权限来创建
all you do is you use privileges to create

784
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,800
所有你做的是你使用权限来创建他们和管理他们
all you do is you use privileges to create them and manage them

785
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,833
编写和管理它们
them and manage them

786
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,866
而且你再也不用处理这些代码了
and you just never deal with that code ever again

787
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,866
而且你再也不用处理这些代码了
and you just never deal with that code ever again

788
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,166
我认为这应该让你有更多的机会
which i think should make you quite a bit

789
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,666
我认为这应该使你
which I think should make you

790
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:20,733
相当多的生产力
quite a bit more productive

791
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,666
如果你要处理大量的故事书，就会更有成效。
more productive if you're dealing with a lot of with storybook

792
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:21,733
如果你要处理大量的
if you're dealing with a lot of

793
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:22,633
故事书
with storybook

794
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,100
这是即将到来的，希望在今年年底之前
that's upcoming hopefully before the end of the year

795
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,533
这是即将到来的
that's upcoming

796
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,099
希望在今年年底之前
hopefully before the end of the year

797
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,966
但我有一个8个月大的孩子要照顾，所以
but i do have an eight month old baby to take care of so

798
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,966
但我确实有一个8个月大的婴儿需要照顾，所以
but I do have an 8 month old baby to take care of so

799
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,566
时间表是困难的
timelines are difficult

800
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:32,999
时间表是很难坚持的
timelines are difficult to stick to

801
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,066
坚守
to stick to

802
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,933
这就是关于特权的问题，所以我
that's about it about privileges so i

803
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,166
这就是关于特权的问题
that's about it about privileges

804
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:36,966
所以我
so I

805
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:40,166
我很想邀请你去看看特权网
would love to invite you to check out privileges com

806
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,666
尝试一下，了解更多信息
to try it out and learn a bit more

807
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,133
这里有很多你可能需要的配置
there's quite a bit of configs that you might need

808
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,133
有很多你可能需要的配置
there's quite a bit of configs that you might need

809
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,199
所以我给你看的所有的例子都是
so all of the examples that i've shown you are

810
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,233
所以我给你看的所有的例子都是
so all of the examples that I've shown you are

811
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,533
绝对零配置
absolutely zero config

812
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,533
绝对零配置
absolutely 0 config

813
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,500
但这是相当
but it's quite

814
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,633
但很有可能，如果你有一个更多的
but it's quite likely that if you have a more

815
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,933
有可能，如果你有一个更复杂的项目，如它的下一个
likely that if you have a more complex project like it's next

816
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:51,466
复杂的项目
complex project

817
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:51,933
像它小于
like it's less than

818
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,866
你正在使用氧化还原或类似的东西
you're using redox or something like that

819
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,899
你在使用氧化还原或类似的东西
you're using redox or something like that

820
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,466
你将需要设置
you will need to set up

821
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,233
你将需要设置像说唱者一样的东西来设置
you will need to set up like rappers to set up the

822
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:58,666
饶舌的人，以建立你知道的反应背景或
rappers to set up the you know react context or

823
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:58,666
反应上下文或
react context or

824
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:01,566
设置别名的所有这些东西，所以
set up aliases all these kind of stuff so

825
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:01,100
设置别名，所有这些东西
set up aliases all these kind of stuff

826
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,533
所以所有这些都在网站上有记录

827
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
所有这些在网站上都有记录
