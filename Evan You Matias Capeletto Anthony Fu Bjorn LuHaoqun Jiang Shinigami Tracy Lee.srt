让我们继续，并从以下方面开始
let's go ahead and start with

55
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,599
情绪化 是情绪化

00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,999
我还记得我们第一次观看时的咳嗽声。

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
那是当面的，这个是虚拟的，但还是

当他第一次

他第一次来的时候，跟我说了这个想法。

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,566
我们想做一个V字形的咳嗽，我很怀疑，我当时想
we want to do a v cough i was quite skeptical i was like

63
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
你确定吗？

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,333
也许我们没有足够的人感兴趣
maybe we don't have enough people that's interested

65
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:33,366
但是

74
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,933
我们没有积极跟踪
we are not actively keeping track of

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
每个人在生态系统中都在做什么
what everyone's doing in the ecosystem

76
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,499
但现在同时每个人都在

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
选择

91
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:47,533
Vitcomf是他们做这个宣布的地方
vitcomf to be their place where they do this announcement

92
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,666
就像我们今天看到的那样
eh like we we saw today

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,466
伊恩从一本故事书中
ian from a storybook

94
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,266
说，在故事书的第七点O
saying that in the storybook seven point o

95
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,500
将会有这样的情况
there is going to be like

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,333
网络包不再需要了
the web pack was not going to be needed anymore

97
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,866
所以只有当你在Vitap中时才会有Vit。
so it's going to be vit only if you are in a vitap

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,200
所以这是个重大的消息

00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:08,133
我们看到了，他们知道与Vit一起工作

Lucas来自Rodap
lucas from rodap

102
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,866
特别是选择这种饮食方式来发布Rodap 3
choose this diet in particular to release rodap three

103
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,299
这对我们来说是很重要的
that is like enormous for us

104
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,866
就像我们现在需要开始在rodap 4上工作一样
like that we need to start working on rodap 4 now

105
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,900
但正如七号所说的那样，有很多事情
but as seven said like there there is like a lot of

106
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,599
今天发生的事情

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,133
我们需要几周的时间来解读
it will take us like weeks to unpack

108
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,533
所有发生的事情，就在
everything that happens just

109
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,733
就像在过去的12个小时里
like in the in the past twelve hours

110
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,599
听起来有很多工作要做
a lot more work it sounds like

111
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,666
这当然是一种祝福
which is a blessing of course

112
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
对开放商来说是福也是祸
a blessing and a curse for opensores

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
嗯
well

114
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:48,966
你谈到了一些大的展览，但还有谁对这些展览有意见？
mts you kind of talked about a few of the big

115
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,133

116
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,733

118
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,399
任何其他你觉得有趣的公告

00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,199
我在想，目前大约
i'm thinking currently about

121
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,299
一年半前
one and a half year ago

122
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
甚至你也对那个团队大喊大叫
even you made that team shout out

123
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,933
为寻找一个团队的节拍和

128
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,900

yeah

142
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,799
我想我必须要
i think i have to

143
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,933
给予材料一个巨大的支持，因为
give a huge shotout to materials because

144
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,999
我认为他是这个世界上唯一的人
i think he's the only person in this

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,266
在这整个前线和世界中
in this whole front and world to

146
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,466
掌握了海滩生态系统的全貌
get the whole picture of the beach ecosystem

147
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:43,666
这是我第一次看到这么多的
it's the first time that i've seen so many

148
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:48,599
包我们的团队在一周内
packages our teams around the week to

149
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
一起出现，并且
show up together and

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
我很高兴看到这个公告
i'm very excited to see the announcement

151
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,266
在我的时间里，所以它是在昨天晚上，卷起维持卢卡斯
in my time so it's last night that the roll up maintain lucas

152
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:04,766
那
that

153
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:10,133
实际上，从技术上讲，他并不属于GT生态系统的一部分
he actually technically he's not part of the gt ecosystem

154
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,666
因为他是一个通用的
because he's a universal

155
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,933
工具的前端，但他选择了
front end of tool but he choose to

156
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,799
用这个舞台来宣布
use this stage to announce that the

157
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,199
抟土机是开放的
roll up is open

158
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,100
为
for

159
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,366
rasta
rasta

160
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:30,299
改写，我想这对我来说是非常兴奋的。
rewriting and i think that's very excited for me

161
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:36,133
是的，我很兴奋，在Rula树是一个相当大的消息
yeah i'm quite excited in rula tree is quite a big news

162
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,766
我认为Steplets也在尝试
and i think steplets as well trying

163
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:41,599
这么多的功能，只是一个小小的谈话
so many features out and just one small talk

164
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,133
我迫不及待地想使用它
i can't wait to use it

165
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,099
而且我认为
and i think

166
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,766
我错过了很多会议，因为我必须要睡觉
i missed quite a bit of the conference because i have to sleep

167
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:50,966
但我肯定会在下半场赶上他们的。
but i'm definitely catching them in a second half

168
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,166
这真的很好
it's really good

169
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,999
是的，我必须承认，我还没有完成所有我的
yeah i have to confess that i haven't finished all my

170
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,366
我不得不承认，我还没有看完我所有的演讲，因为像顶部的内容是很疯狂的。
other talks since like top hours of content is crazy

171
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,133
是的，由于绑在一起的圆顶，我正要离开，我刚刚醒来。
and yeah due to the tying dome i was leaving and i just wake up

172
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,100
试图赶上会谈，所以我之前没有完成。
and trying to catch up the talks so i didn't finish before

173
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,499
在我们进入这个小组之前
before we go into this panel

174
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:19,299
但我想说的是，我对整个生态系统印象非常深刻。
but yeah i'd like to say that i'm really impressive about

175
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:25,466
我想说的是，我真的对整个生态系统印象深刻，这些创新的灵感来自于社区内部的合作。
the whole ecosystem the innovations created inspired by bits of

176
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,133
社区内部的合作，提出了很多想法
the collaboration inside of the community that come up with

177
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,900
这么多的想法和
so many ideas and to

178
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:34,766
像
like

179
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:40,099
涉及我们的日常工作流程或开发人员的经验，以
involve our daily workflows or developer experience to

180
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,666
所以是的，我真的对我们的社区印象深刻。
push that much forward so yeah i'm really

181
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,100
我对我们的社区印象深刻
impressed about the community we had

182
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,200
我对我们的社区留下了深刻的印象，因为我们的节奏和错误的节奏，是的
for the beat and the wrong beat yeah

183
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
好的
well

184
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,099
我只是
and i will just

185
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:59,066
试着完成所有的谈话
try to finish all the talks

186
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,600
今天晚些时候
later today

187
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,133
是的
yeah

188
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,866
我也一样，其实我错过了不少。
same for me i actually missed quite a few of them

189
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,866
所以我也在努力追赶
so i'm trying to catch up as well

190
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,333
但这是我的想法
but that was the idea

191
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,166
它需要像这样工作，因为现在你喜欢
it needs to work like that because now you like

192
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:18,299
整个亚洲和欧洲都有机会看到这些作品了
all of asia and europe also has opportunity to see them all

193
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:20,399
这很好
that's good

194
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,699
有一件事我很喜欢
and one thing i like

195
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:30,933
聊天就像Shini说的那样，一直是这样的
the chat as shini was saying like it has been like this

196
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,566
就像它已经有11个小时的
like it has been like eleven hours of

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
像内容
like content

198
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,100
一个持续的内容，来自
a constant content from

199
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,466
就像很多社区一样，当
like a lot of communities when

200
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,100
这很有趣，因为像
it was interesting because like

201
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,000
我不知道，就像在实星
i don't know like in the solid star

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,533
与Ryan的谈话
talk with ryan

203
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,399
整个固体社区都来到了Withland
the whole solid community came to withland

204
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,566
他们在那里谈话，然后像
and they were talking there and then like the

205
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,733
在 "快狗 "里也是这样
in the quick dog the same was there

206
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,599
或在下一个股票中，如
or in the next stock like

207
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,099
景观社区也在那里，而且
the view community was there and

208
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
就像在一个特定的渠道，它是像
like in one particular channel it was like

209
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,166
疯狂的速度
crazy how fast

210
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,899
文字是去
the text was going

211
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,933
有多少人在那里互动
of how many people were interacting there

212
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,466
是的，从这个角度来说，有很多事情要做。
yeah branching off of that there's a lot going on

213
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:13,566
在一个会议期间
during a conference

214
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,566
团队是如何合作的
how does the team work together

215
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:19,466
我的意思是，由于时区和一切，你如何
i mean with the time zones and everything how do you

216
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,866
团队是如何一起工作的？
how does the team get to work together

217
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,399
是的，所以最初当我
yeah so originally when i

218
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:26,933
开始组建团队时
started the team

219
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,333
我们有意让整个
we intentionally made the whole

220
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:32,199
类似于视图团队的工作方式。
similar to how the view team works we

221
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,666
让它在结构上相当
make it quite

222
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,666
在结构上很松散
loose in terms of structure

223
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,199
团队成员只是决定
team members just decide

224
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,133
什么是重要的
what's important

225
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,166
足够让他们在游戏中投入时间的工作
enough for them to work on to invest their time game

226
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,366
所以没有真正的
so there's no really

227
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,866
严格的责任本身
hard responsibilities per se

228
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,933
基本上，我没有，我没有到处去说嘿
essentially i don't i don't go around and say hey

229
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:51,933
就像这是你的工作
like this is your job

230
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,066
你需要做这个
you need to do this

231
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
或类似的东西
or anything like that

232
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,866
而其中一个原因是
and one of the reasons

233
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:00,799
人们成为团队成员的原因之一
people become team members similar

234
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,333
我试图在开放源码周围做的事情是
to how i try to do things around open source is

235
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,166
积极的贡献者
motivated contributors

236
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,566
通常会出现在
typically will show up the

237
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,000
自己站出来
step up by themselves

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,500
因为他们通常对这个项目充满热情
because they are generally passionate about the project

239
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,300
所以
so

240
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,333
他们有自然的动力去注意什么是重要的
they have the natural drive to notice what's important

241
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,366
因为他们在思考如何改进项目
because they are thinking about how to improve the project

242
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,733
所以他们注意到需要解决的问题
so they notice the problems that needs to be solved

243
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:25,799
他们会努力去做
and they work on it

244
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
我认为这对于
and i think that's critical in

245
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,366
我认为这对建立一个能够自我驱动的团队至关重要
building a team that can be self driven

246
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:31,666
在某种程度上
in a way

247
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:37,899
因此，除此之外，我们试图通过每周的分流会议来做
so outside ofthat we try to do by weekly triage meetings where

248
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:39,666
所以
so

249
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:44,166
我们试图在我们不开会的时候，把问题分门别类地组织起来
we try to organize in triage that issues when we're not meeting

250
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:46,999
把它们分为不同的优先类别
put them into different priority categories

251
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,333
当一个问题进来的时候
when an issue comes in

252
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,066
我们看到好吧，这是一个功能请求还是一个降压报告
we see okay is this a feature request or a buck report

253
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:55,399
所以这些都是有法可依的，我们有一个工作流程。
so these are kind of codified we have a workflow for that

254
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,166
因此，团队中的每个人都可以帮助
so everyone anyone on the team can help

255
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,933
把问题放到正确的桶里
to put the issues in the right buckets

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
所以我们有一个板块
so we have a board

257
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,499
我们有一个板子，所有这些问题都被分类
where all these issues are kind of sorted

258
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,566
分成不同的类别
into different categories

259
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,933
所以在我们的团队会议上
so during our team meetings is where

260
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,199
我们大多数人都会聚在一起，按照优先级来处理这些问题
most of us would get together and go through these by priority

261
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
和
and

262
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,766
通常，如果一个问题是没有争议的
usually if if a issue is non controversial

263
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
团队成员就可以提出解决方案。
team members can just whoever happens to work on

264
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,600
就可以提出一个解决方案，如果
it can just propose a solution and if

265
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,466
另一个团队成员证明了这一点
another team member proves it

266
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,000
我们就可以直接合并，然后去做
we can just merge and go right

267
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,000
所以通常
so typically

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,466
我们讨论的事情和会议是那些
the things we discuss and meetings are the ones that

269
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,933
有相对较大的影响
have relatively bigger impact

270
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:39,333
我们是否需要达成共识或直接从我这里获得投入？
do we need to get a consensus or get input from me directly

271
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,733
来决定我们的行动说好吧，这是我们要做的事情
to call our shots say okay this is what we're gonna do

272
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,299
这不是我们要做的事情
this is not what we're gonna do

273
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:48,733
所以我认为到目前为止，这对我们来说是非常有效的
so i think so far that's been working pretty well for us

274
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,000
而且很明显
and obviously

275
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,566
这一切都很有效
all of this kind of works

276
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,299
因为有马蒂亚斯，他不知疲倦地
because there's matias who's just tirelessly

277
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,266
他不知疲倦地与团队以外的人接触
sort of reaching out to people outside the team

278
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,700
并带来反馈
and bringing feedback

279
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,900
所以
so

280
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,900
他可以为我们提供内部信息，让我们做出更明智的决定。
he can provide the inside for us to make more informed positions

281
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,600
所以，是的，这几乎是它的工作方式。
so yeah that's pretty much how it works

282
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,266
我还想补充一点
i would also like to add

283
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,666
所以是的，我真的很高兴我发生Evan是如何
so yeah i'm really happily i occur how evan is

284
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:19,399
构建这个团队和
structuring this team and

285
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:23,933
帕塔格领导的会议等等。
patag is leading the meetings and so on and

286
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,500
在其中一次
in one of the

287
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,366
在一次会议上，好像是半年前
meetings likethink half a year ago also

288
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,866
我需要打一针或者给Anthony Fu，因为
i need to make a shot or to anthony fu because

289
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,333
我们讨论了我认为是关于
we had a discussion about i think about just

290
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:46,733
这就是我们使用的测试系统。
and that's the test system we are using invited save

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,266
是真的很慢
is really slow

292
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:55,566
是的，然后我们做了我认为是一个笑话，我们说
and yeah then we made i think it came off of a joke that we said

293
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,366
像我们测试，然后
something like we test and then

294
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,766
第二天的食物
and food on the next day

295
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,166
创建了测试，并围绕它建立了一个完整的生态系统
created the test and around that is a complete ecosystem

296
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
老板的子弹等等，安东尼也在
boss bullet and so on and anthony is also

297
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:15,466
推广最近的积极项目
pushing out the positive recent projects

298
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,399
像其他人一样，而且
like no one elseand

299
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,566
我依靠他在我的Oatma酱项目中，我正在
i'm depending on him on in my oatma sauce project i'm

300
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,933
依靠我的公司项目
depending on my company projects

301
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:32,333
因此，即使是你也不例外
and so not also even you

302
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,200
视图生态系统，但也包括安东尼。
the view ecosystem but also anthony this

303
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,933
都有存储库
all have has repositories

304
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:45,599
是的，它是一个巨大的生态系统。
it's so it's yeah it's such a huge ecosystem

305
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,066
而且
and

306
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:52,299
在过去的一半时间里，我没有在这里做任何这么多的事情。
in the last half here i didn't do any so much in

307
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,900
杂草了，和以前一样，因为
weed anymore and as before because

308
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,933
因为我成为了faker jazz的维护者。
because i became the maintainer of faker jazz

309
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:02,933
和但是
and but

310
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,499
甚至这也有帮助，因为
even this is helping because

311
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:10,799
当我使用像v和view以及v test之类的东西时
when i'm using stuff like v and view and v test and so on

312
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,466
我可以向Patak报告
i can report back

313
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,700
向Patak报告我们是如何使用这些东西的，而且
stuff to patak how we use that and

314
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
还有
also

315
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,000
我们
we

316
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,533
我们还讨论了
discussed

317
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,900
一个关于劳动的例子和
an example about labours and

318
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,466
git up如何管理
git up how to manage

319
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,800
储存库等等。
repository and so on and

320
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,899
所有这些项目
all these projects

321
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,166
互相改进
improve

322
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,466
彼此的关系
by each other

323
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,499
是的，这也是非常非常酷的
yeah and that's also really really cool

324
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,400
是的
yeah

325
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,600
谢谢你，其实我觉得
thank you and i actually i feel

326
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,899
其实我觉得自己的功劳太大了
quite being over over credit

327
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:57,399
所以我想和维塔斯类似 我认为维塔斯不是一个人的作品
so i guess similar to vit i think vitas is not a one man work

328
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,999
那就像...
and that's like um

329
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,933
我想这是为社会创造的。
i think that's created to the community and

330
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,900
我们有的东西或者说我们为海滩建立的基础
the thing we had or the foundation we had for the beach

331
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,766
所以第一个想法
so the the first idea

332
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,066
我们的团队提出的第一个要求是
or the first demand that comes from our team to

333
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,399
说什么什么测试地狱
say what what the test inferno

334
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,600
我们会建议和
we would recommend and

335
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,200
核心的镁元素，就像嗯，这是
the core magnesian to like um that's

336
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
维生素流淌的未知是
vit runny unknown is

337
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,533
基于维生素提供的功能和最初的想法
based on the feature vit provide and also the initial idea

338
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,533
我们的工作是解决Preya提供的SSR问题。
we work sound knocks to solve the ssr issues that preya provide

339
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:35,199
所有这些都是为了使维塔斯成为一个可能的想法
to all these things to make vitas possible as an idea

340
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,366
然后我们
and then we

341
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:39,766
然后我们在Patak和许多人的帮助下组建了一个Vitas团队。
have a kind of vitas team with the help of

342
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,299
在Patak和许多
from patak and from many

343
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,266
我们的团队成员的帮助下，使这些事情发生，委员会
our team members to make these things happens and the committee

344
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,566
他们推动了这些工具的发展
they kind of push the tools forward

345
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,099
以达到我们目前的状态
to be the current states that we

346
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,099
某种程度上是非常
kind of being like very

347
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,533
满足的方式，能够
satisfy ways to being able to

348
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,866
适应我们的需求与像更多
fit our needs with the like more

349
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:05,566
与适合的生态系统合作
collaborations with the fit ecosystem

350
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,600
我认为这就是我所做的事情
and i think that's being just being what i am

351
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,600
其中一个例子，我们如何
one of the examples that how we

352
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,066
团结这个
united this

353
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,333
社区和
community and

354
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,300
我想，这就是我们如何将这个社区联合起来并使之成为一个普遍性的社区。
make things i think universals for each others

355
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,133
我也想把它关闭
i would also like to shut out

356
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,699
就像我们给每个人都打了预防针
like since we are giving shutouts to everybody

357
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:41,133
给雅恩和萨菲，就像萨菲也会在这里一样
to yarn and to safi that is like safi shall be here also

358
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:46,266
就像Hin normalis在会议上在团队会议上一样
that like hin normalis in the meetings in the team meetings

359
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,666
而且他们一直在做
and like they have been doing

360
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,300
他们在Triashin和修复盒子方面做了如此惊人的工作
such an amazing work with triashin and fixing box

361
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,566
就像在过去
like in the past

362
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,366
六个月或一年的时间里，像
six months or a year like

363
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,166
如果你把Chassim考虑进去，在第三位发生了什么？
if you take chassim to account what happened in bit three

364
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:01,533
就像我们有八个
like we had eight

365
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,966
八百个问题开放
eight hundred issues open

366
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,400
和像他们开始的春天
and like they started the spring

367
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,266
关闭它的时候，yarn发了一条微博说
to close it yarn send a tweet saying

368
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,199
我将
i will

369
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,900
把开放的问题减少到我不知道像什么
take the open issues down to i don't know like what

370
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,666
一百期，我不知道什么时候
one hundred i don't know whenever

371
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:18,499
有一天你会达到
you are going to reach someday

372
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:21,966
但它从八百个变成了四百个
but it went from eight hundred to four hundred

373
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,099
两个月的时间里，那是
shass in like two months and that was

374
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,899
就像沙士一样令人印象深刻
like shads just impressive

375
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,266
就像苏达也参与到了其中一样
like also soda got involved there would like

376
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,566
这就像一个人的领导
which like the lead of a one

377
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,066
去通过所有的问题
to go through all of the issues

378
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:42,933
而这就像我是惊人的像去像每一个每一个
and that just like i'm amazing like going like every every

379
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:46,199
单一问题和信用像一个精神
single issue and credit like a mental

380
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,766
它不像我被称为它，但像一个地图
and it's not like that i was called it but like a map

381
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:53,566
的类别是什么，我们应该关注的事情
of categories of what are the things that we should focus on

382
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,966
与月球前进，这也是非常有用的
with moon forward that is also really helpful

383
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,900
这是非常鼓舞人心的，因为我刚刚给了这个讲座关于
this is so inspiring because i just gave this talk about

384
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,066
如何为开放源码做贡献
how to contribute to open source

385
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:09,333
今天我正在谈论这一切，并且
and was talking about all this today and

386
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,799
我想你知道像
i think you know like

387
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,766
你刚才提到的一些东西，Mateus是很好的方法，其他的人有可能参与进来。
some of the stuff you just mentioned mateus are great ways that

388
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,133
其他人有可能参与进来，你知道
other people could potentially get involved you know

389
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,966
你不需要考虑
you don't have to think about

390
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,333
我不是
i'm not

391
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,999
你不必考虑我没有安东尼那么好，也不必创造所有这些东西
never as good as anthony and creating all these things

392
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,766
但你知道还有很多其他的方式可以让你成为
but you know there's so many other ways you can become

393
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,700
所以
so

394
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,866
对开放源码项目的成功至关重要，比如Beat。
critical to the success of open source projects such as beat so

395
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,666
我想还有人要讲
i think somebody else was going to talk

396
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,666
但我听到
though did i hear

397
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,499
有人取消了静音，想做其他评论
somebody unmute and want to make other comments

398
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,100
我只想说谢谢你
i'll just try and say thank you

399
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,166
在这一点上
at that point

400
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,766
这个房间里有这么多的爱
there's so much love in this room

401
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,500
不，这真的很好，还有
no it's really great and also

402
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
我还得说，你知道的，你知道的，你知道的。
i have to say you know cutus and shout out to

403
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:56,999
听见你的方式
kind of hearing the way

404
00:20:57,366 --> 00:21:01,299
Evan你决定用你们两个人的方式来组织团队
evan you kind of decided to structure the team with both of you

405
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,166
和节拍
and beat

406
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,000
你知道这很惊人
you know it's amazing what

407
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,899
惊人的是，现金和它的人谁走到一起
cash and it people who come together

408
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:13,766
想解决困难问题的人，在没有政治的情况下可以做到这一点。
who want to solve hard problems can do with lack of politics

409
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:15,199
所以
so

410
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:18,699
很高兴看到能够发生的创新
it's great to see the innovation that has been able to happen

411
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,066
你知道有点像在企业门外
you know kind of like outside corporate doors

412
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,533
如果我可以这么说的话，在企业的开放源码之外
outside of corporate open source if i could say that

413
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,666
所以我想你知道那种去，你知道你们都有
so i guess you know kind of going to that you know you all have

414
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,266
提供了很多非常了不起的例子，说明
provided a lot of really amazing examples on how

415
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:36,899
这里的团队成员
team members here

416
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,900
有你知道能够帮助
haveyou know been able to help

417
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,099
成功的例子
vet be successful

418
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,333
但其他人如何能参与其中呢？
but how can others get involved you know

419
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,100
对于坐在那里听着的开发者来说，现在想要
for that developer sitting there listening right now wanting to

420
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,100
想做下一件事，比如他们能做什么来帮助兽医？
wanting to do the next thing like what can they do to help vet

421
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:57,999
好吧，我认为
well i think

422
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,866
有不同的方式
there are different ways of

423
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,966
成为社区的一部分并作出贡献
being part of the community and contributing

424
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:03,766
所以
so

425
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:06,599
我总是说，即使只是
i always say even just

426
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,866
上网聊天，互相帮助
going on discord and help each other out

427
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,666
回答别人的问题
answering other people's questions

428
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,599
也是一种贡献
is a form of contribution

429
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,733
所以分享知识分享经验
so share a knowledge share experience

430
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,566
回答问题，也许我也会堆叠溢出，所以这些都是
answering questions maybe i'll stack overflow also so these are

431
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,400
任何人都可以做的最低限度的事情
the lowest kind of hanging fruits anyone can do

432
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,933
如果你想走得更远
if you want to go a bit

433
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:30,766
贡献自己的力量
further and directly contribute to v yourself

434
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,499
你可以看一下我们的期刊列表
you can take a look at our issue list

435
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,866
我们总是有大量的新问题涌入
we always have tons of new issues coming in

436
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,699
所以帮助我们分流它们
so help us triage them

437
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,866
你知道，如果这样的话，通常
you know if so typically

438
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,766
我们花了很多时间来解决这个问题。
we try it we spend a lot of time figuring out with

439
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:47,199
如何重现一个问题，所以帮助我们
how to reproduce a problem so help us

440
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,166
你知道你可以帮助我们
you know you can help us with

441
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:53,533
证实好吧，这也发生在我的系统上
verifying okay this is happening on my system as well

442
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,499
这是发生的，你知道
this is happening you know

443
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,766
也许可以减少再现的范围，使之更容易
maybe reducing the scope of the reproduction to make it easier

444
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:00,366
让我们更容易确定问题所在
for us to identify the problem

445
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:02,933
或者即使你自己发现了这个问题
or even if you identify the fix yourself

446
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,099
你知道的，提交一份报告来修复它
you know submit a pr to fix it

447
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:06,866
所以
so

448
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,466
这些都是一种自然的进步，对吗？
these are kind of natural progression right

449
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:12,566
所以你可以从帮助别人开始
so you can start with just helping other people out

450
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:14,766
然后帮助三根问题
and then helping trirogen issues

451
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,566
一旦你做了一段时间，你就会对它有所了解。
and once you do that for a while you kind of get a hand of it

452
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:18,566
你也可以
you can also

453
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,966
跟随阿拉娜的问题，看看它是如何被解决的
follow alana issue to see how it got fixed

454
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,133
跟踪整个过程
to follow through the process

455
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:26,533
看看其他人是如何提交报告的
see how other people have submitted a pr

456
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,699
所以你可以从中学习，然后你就可以自己做了。
so you learn from it and then you can do it yourself

457
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,500
我认为这不仅仅适用于V
i think this kind of applies not just to v

458
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,900
也适用于任何类型的开源项目，对吗？
but to any kind of open source project right

459
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,700
所以
so

460
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,699
如果你不知道如何进入，你就必须学习
if you don't know how to get in you kind of have to learn

461
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,766
你就得学习一下
around a little bit

462
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,566
看看别人是怎么做的
just see how other people are doing it

463
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
这就是我进入开源项目的原因
that's how i got into open source

464
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,666
这也是我学习写代码的原因
that's how i learned to write code actually

465
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,966
我是通过阅读github上其他人的代码来学习的
i learned by just reading other people's code on github

466
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:48,566
因为一切
because everything

467
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,199
是开放的，所以
is open right so

468
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,600
所有求爱者所做的事情也都是开放的
all the things that courting numbers are doing are also open

469
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,400
对，你可以
right you can

470
00:23:56,666 --> 00:24:00,399
你可以看看你知道的人们提交的PSR，以吃
take a look at you know the prs people have submitted to eat

471
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,400
看看他们是如何使用它的
see how they're working with it

472
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:06,066
这也有助于你熟悉代码库。
that helps you familiarize with the code base as well

473
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,966
所以是的
so yeah

474
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,133
事实上，很多人都是这样开始的
that's in fact how a lot of people got

475
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,666
我们大部分的核心团队成员都是通过提交小的PRS开始的
most of our core team members started by submitting small prs

476
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,666
你知道，mythia提交的第一个项目
you know the first pr

477
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,899
mythia提交的第一个项目只是修改了一个标题
mythia submitted was just fixing a title

478
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,366
然后他就越来越多地参与进来
and then he got more and more involved

479
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,499
并最终成为团队成员。
and eventually become a team member right

480
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,300
所以
so

481
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:31,733
你从小事做起，坚持做下去，我们就会
you start with small things do it consistently and we will

482
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:34,766
你知道那些与项目互动的团队成员
you know the team members who interact with the project

483
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,699
每天都会注意到，你一直在那里
daily will notice that you've been there

484
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,866
你一直在贡献，所以
you've been contributing so

485
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:42,066
所以我们有一个提名过程，在这个过程中
so we have a nomination process where

486
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,300
团队的现有成员可以说，嘿
team current team members can say hey

487
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:45,733
这个人最近
this person has been

488
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:48,466
最近做了很好的工作，我们认为
doing great work lately and we think

489
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:50,566
他或她应该加入我们的团队。
he or she should be on the team and

490
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,566
我们会这样做，所以
we'll do that so

491
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,800
这就是典型的过程，在这个过程之外，如果你对v本身的工作不感兴趣的话
that's the typical process and outside of it if you're

492
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,300
如果你对v本身的工作不直接感兴趣
not directly interesting working on v itself

493
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,266
你可以创造出拔苗助长，对吗？
you can create pluckings right

494
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,700
所以，因为事实上
so because in fact

495
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,100
很多人们想要解决的问题
a lot of problems that people are trying to solve

496
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,566
可能不适合在VED核心里面解决，因为
may not be suitable to be solved inside ved core because

497
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,400
我们确实有一个
we do have a

498
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,899
范围问题，因为
scope problem where

499
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,766
因为VID在整个网络工具领域有太多的接触
because vid has so much exposure to the whole

500
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,733
网络工具场景，对吗？
web tooling scene now right

501
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,266
有时我们有一种倾向，说好的
sometimes we have a tendency of saying okay

502
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:24,966
我们希望Feed能做到这一点
we wish feed could do this

503
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:28,066
但也许这样做并不是最好的主意，因为这是有可能的
but maybe it's not the best idea to do it because it's possible

504
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,999
因为它可以通过构建或插入来实现
by just building or plugging for it

505
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,299
在这种情况下
in that case

506
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,700
你可以用一个插件来解决你自己的问题，发布它
you can solve your own problem with a plugging publish it

507
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,666
这样其他人就可以重复使用你的工作
so that other people can reuse your work

508
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,366
我认为这也是一个很好的方法
i think that's also a great way

509
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:40,266
对生态系统的贡献
of contributing to the ecosystem

510
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,066
有一件事
one thing that

511
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,800
补充一下Evans所说的
adding up what evans said

512
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,400
在杂草中，特别是像
in weed in particular like

513
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:57,099
贡献的质量，比如问题，比如
the quality of contributions like issues like

514
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,666
问题的报告方式
how the issues are reported

515
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:01,299
和PRS像他们中的大多数
and the prs like most of them

516
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:02,899
是来自于
are coming from

517
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:05,533
其他项目的维护者，因为像
the maintainers of the other projects because like

518
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:06,899
如果它也增长了很多
if it also grows a lot

519
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,100
伴随着所有其他项目的参与
with all the other projects that are involved

520
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,200
所以大家说的这个事情，就像
so this thing that everyone say about like

521
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:16,066
去杂草丛生的地方，看看其他人是如何做PRS的
go to weed and check how others are like doing the prs

522
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:17,266
或者他们是如何甚至
or how they are even

523
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,499
一个结构在
a structure in

524
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,000
他们的想法，不喜欢他们是如何在问题的百分比
their thoughts no like how they are percent in the problem

525
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:25,066
这是一个学习的好地方，因为
it is a great place to learn that because

526
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,866
你将会看到一个来自
you're going to see a pr from

527
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,099
富有的人从雷亚姆那里进行
rich carries from rayam from

528
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,766
像从快速的人从
like the people from quick from

529
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:34,999
像丹尼尔-罗伊，来自诺克斯，像他们一样，他们都是伟大的
like daniel roy from knox like they like they are all great

530
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,466
开源狐狸，所以你会学到很多东西
open source fox so you're going to learn a lot

531
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,499
跟随他们，就像天堂一样疯狂
by following them like heaven is insane

532
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,966
没错，是的
exactly yeah

533
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:46,399
所以我认为
so i think

534
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,266
我看到很多初学者或刚开始接触开源的人的情况是
what i see a lot from beginners or newcomers to open source is

535
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:52,899
首先，你不知道
first of all you don't know

536
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:53,999
从哪里开始
where to start

537
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:55,666
第二
and the second

538
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,899
有时，也许你第一次尝试提交一份报告。
is sometimes maybe you try for the first time you submit a pr

539
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,700
但
but

540
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:03,499
有一些小东西，这是一种常见的
there are little things that's kind of common

541
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:06,266
礼仪开放源码的地方
etiquetteopen source where

542
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,199
比如当你提交一份报告时
like when you submit a pr

543
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,100
有一些事情你应该避免，比如不要
there are certain things you should avoid like don't

544
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,366
使用格式化器来格式化
use a formatter to format

545
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:14,533
整个文件
the whole file

546
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,066
做出不相关的改变，你知道这些小事情
with unrelated changes you know these small things

547
00:27:17,466 --> 00:27:18,333
然后还有
and then also

548
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,600
如何最好地解释你所要解决的问题
how to best explain the problem you're trying to solve

549
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,100
比如如何让它
like how to make it

550
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,400
更加容易
easier

551
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,866
让维护者做出是否合并的决定
for the maintainer to make the decision to whether merge it

552
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:31,399
事实上，作为一个维护者，我自己
or not in fact as a maintainer myself

553
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,466
很多时候，我最大的纠结是，我得到了一个 "好心人"。
my biggest struggle a lot of times is i get a pr

554
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,199
的意图是好的
with good intentions

555
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,966
但有时可能只是没有真正解释问题
but sometimes maybe it just didn't really explain the problem

556
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:43,333
足够好，所以我很难
well enough so i was having a hard time

557
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:45,466
所以我很难理解为什么需要这样做
understanding why this is needed

558
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,499
所以，通常情况下，最好是你知道
so usually it's better to you know

559
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,499
有一个很好的解释，说明要解决的问题是什么
have a good explainer of what problem is trying to solve

560
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:53,766
我们是如何遇到这个问题的
how we ran into it

561
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:57,699
为什么这个问题只能在项目核心中解决？
why is why this can only be solved inside the project core

562
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,799
这就是我们试图解决它的方法
and this is how we are trying to solve it

563
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,333
也许你已经解释了其他的解决方案，对吗？
maybe other solutions you've explained right

564
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,933
如果你看一下我们一些框架的PRS
if you look at the prs from

565
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,933
我们的一些框架
some of our framework

566
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,733
合作者
collaborators

567
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:10,899
在你的基础上构建东西
for building stuff on top of you

568
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,066
通常他们发送的pr是非常高质量的
usually the pr they sent are very high quality

569
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,666
因为他们通常
because they usually

570
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,166
很好地解释了问题
very well explain the problem

571
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,666
他们遇到的问题，并解释
they're running into and explain

572
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,866
为什么他们认为这是正确的解决方案
why they think this is the right solution

573
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,400
这使得我们更容易考虑，比如好的
and that makes it a lot easier for usto consider like okay

574
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:28,066
这是有意义的，而且
this makes sense and

575
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,166
因此，这也减少了来回奔波的次数。
so it also reduces the amount of back and forth needed

576
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,099
因此，它也减少了来回奔波的次数，所以总体来说
to get feature merch so overall

577
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,900
总的来说，就是让整个过程更快
just makes the whole process faster

578
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:35,766
所以有一个
so there's a

579
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:38,699
通过观察别人的工作，肯定能学到很多东西
definitely a lot to learn just by watching other people work

580
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:41,799
我认为这就是开放源代码的伟大之处
and i think that's the great thing about open source

581
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,199
在github上的好处是
on github is

582
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:46,899
你知道整个过程都是开放给你学习的
you know all the whole process is open for you to learn

583
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,866
我觉得这真的很了不起
that's really amazing i think

584
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,733
我嘲笑Matia的
i laugh at matia's

585
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:02,766
因为你知道
little fix because you know

586
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:05,266
我总是说，我认为每个维护者都是
i always say and i think every single maintainer is

587
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,266
我相信你们团队中的所有人都在想，我们可以从哪里开始？
i'm sure all of you all on the team are like where can we start

588
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,133
也许你可以帮助我们解决 "码头权 "的问题
maybe you could help with the docksright

589
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,199
这是一个我们经常听到的事情
it's a very common thing that we hear

590
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:15,733
你知道所有的开源项目都需要
that you know all open source projects need and

591
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,399
如果我们看一下，让我们看一个例子
if we look at let's see as an example

592
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,333
现在就像
now right like

593
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,499
那个小项目
that small little pr

594
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,999
把它变成了更惊人的东西，而且
turned it to something so much more amazing and

595
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:25,599
这就是你知道的
it's you know

596
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
这就是小事，不要低估小事和
it's the small things and don't discount the small things and

597
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,299
你的能力是可以参与其中的
your ability to be able to be involved that way

598
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,866
所以我现在很兴奋
so i'm excited now

599
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:35,933
我需要进入V的生态系统，找出我可以做的事情
i need to go into the v ecosystem and figure out what i can do

600
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,899
你知道我在这场战斗中得到了很大的启发
you know i'm so inspired by this battle

601
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,933
但接下来的问题
but moving on to the next question

602
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,499
JEN要问的是
jen's about to ask like

603
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:49,066
每个人都在等待的大问题
the big question that everyone's waiting for

604
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:54,133
是的，那么下一个问题是什么？
yeah so what is next for beat

605
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,800
是的，那是
yeah that's

606
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,899
是的，这是个很重要的问题，说实话
a quite a loaded question and to be honest

607
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
说实话，我们并没有打算做这种像
to be honest we don't have this like

608
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:11,499
说实话，我们并没有打算做那种大乐队的事情，因为
big band kind of thing that we're planning to do because

609
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,966
因为在这个时候，我们认为
at this moment we think

610
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,733
我们已经在本质上达到了
v has essentially reached a

611
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,566
临界质量，有很多更多的
critical mass where there are a lot more

612
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,066
有更多的东西被建立在它的上面
things that's being built on top of it

613
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,133
所以
so

614
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,533
我想这是一个时期，我们正在努力
i think it's a period where we're trying to

615
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:31,466
稳定下来，让人们在上面进行迭代。
stabilize and let people iterate on top and

616
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:35,466
因为VED已经经历了它自己的移动
because ved has gone through its own moving

617
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,133
因为VED已经经历了它自己的移动和破坏的阶段，现在
fast and break things phase now

618
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:37,999
而现在
and now

619
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,133
因为Ved已经经历了它自己的快速发展和破坏阶段，现在其他人正在它上面进行迭代，所以我们不得不
other people are iterating on top of it so we kind of have to

620
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:45,166
已经开始考虑我们如何确保我们所做的事情
had started thinking about how we make sure that things

621
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,299
我们所做的事情不会影响到在它上面的建设。
we do don't affect things as being a build on top of it

622
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,266
这就是为什么我们也投资于像生态系统这样的东西。
which is why we also invested in things like the ecos ecosystem

623
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:53,766
ci，它
ci which

624
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:55,799
确保一切
make sure that everything

625
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,900
我们所做的一切都不会意外地破坏上面的东西。
we land doesn't break things accidentally on top

626
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,866
所以
so

627
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,366
所以我认为现在
so i think right now

628
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:06,766
就在这个非常时刻，这个重点实际上只是
like for this very moment this focus is in fact just

629
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:07,899
确保小麦
making sure wheat

630
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,000
能够很好地作为评论层的作用
can serve well as the commentating layer

631
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,799
确保我们
making sure that we

632
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,166
确保你知道
making sure that you know

633
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:18,566
它是它是因为有
it's it's because there are

634
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,666
还有很多小事情需要我们去解决
still a lot of little things that we need to fix

635
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:21,466
和
and

636
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,933
我们正试图利用这个机会
we're trying to take this moment to also

637
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:28,499
收集人们在它上面的反馈，看看
gather feedback from people building on top of it to see

638
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,666
接下来我们可以做什么？
what is the next thing that we can

639
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:34,933
显著改善他们所有人的情况，因为
significantly improve for all of them because

640
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:37,533
说实话，从我个人的
to be honest from my personalized

641
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:40,266
我已经解决了大部分的问题
perspective i've solved most of the problems

642
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,299
我一开始就想用Beat来解决
i started out to solve with beat

643
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,599
作为一个用户，我对它超级满意
like i'm super happy with it as a user myself

644
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:46,999
但现在
but now

645
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,566
我们有更多的用户，而不仅仅是建立的人
we have more users than just people building

646
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:51,266
现在，我们有更多的用户，而不仅仅是直接使用V来构建应用程序的人
directly using v to build apps now

647
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,999
我们有这些框架作者
we have these framework authors

648
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,366
而且我们面临着很多不同的需求
and we are facing a lot of different needs

649
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:57,999
把我们拉向不同的方向
pulling us in different directions

650
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,166
我们需要一个时间来考虑
and we need a time to sort of

651
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,333
思考什么是重叠的东西？
think about what is that overlapping things that

652
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:07,133
我们可以让所有这些框架一起受益。
we could benefit all of these frameworks together yeah

653
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,799
我想Mattes可能已经有了一些东西，他已经有了
and i think mattes may have something that he's already had

654
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,266
他已经有了自己的想法，他想把他推到前面去
he already has in mind that he wants to push him before

655
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,133
我觉得就像你说的，我们做的很多事情都是这样的
now i think that it's like you said like a lot of what we did

656
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,800
自从有了两个人之后，我们做的很多事情都是在看里面的东西，并试图像
since with two has been like looking inside and trying to like

657
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:28,766
让它... ...我不知道如何减少盒子的数量
make it i don't know reduce the box like

658
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:33,333
试图从一些碎布蛋转移到其他金属或
trying to move like from some rag eggs to like other metals or

659
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,066
我知道，我认为向前发展，会有很多的
i know i think that moving forward there will be a lot of

660
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,599
比如说移动到卷起来，不会被
moving to roll up for example that will not be

661
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,166
外界感觉不到那么多
felt that much outside

662
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,766
但在内部，这将使6个更容易维护
but internally it will make six more maintainable

663
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,266
我们可以替换一些部件，比如
we could replace some parts maybe like

664
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,966
代替pos css
instead of pos css

665
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:54,599
我们可以使用包裹团队的照明CSS。
we could use lighting css from the parcel team

666
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,466
有一个来自Devon的Pock在那里转悠
there was a pock going around there from devon

667
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,966
所以是的，我不知道我怎么想的
so yeah i don't know like i think

668
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,400
一段时间内，它仍然是一种更多的内省
for a while it will still be kind of like more introspective

669
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:11,966
变化和提供基础
changes and giving the base that

670
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:15,599
你说的是需要别人来创新的 是的
you say is needed for others to innovate on yeah

671
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,933
有一件事我们一直在
one thing we've been

672
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
我们一直在考虑一个潜在的事情，但这是
one potential thing we've been thinking about but this is

673
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,400
我们一直在考虑一个潜在的问题，但这是更进一步的问题
a bit more further down the road

674
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:25,966
我们最终想解决的一个瓶颈是
one of the bottleneck that we want to solve eventually

675
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,799
从长远来看是
in the long term is the

676
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,900
开发过程中的请求量
the amount of requests during development

677
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,200
当你有成千上万的请求时
when you have like thousands of requests

678
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:36,099
他们只是在网络层面上的拥挤
they're just congesting at the network level

679
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,800
这一点，v to self是无法解决的
which v to self is not able to solve

680
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
只是由于急切的性质与
just due to the eager nature vs

681
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:45,066
本机的ESM导入，但可能有潜在的
native esm imports but there could be potential

682
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:47,533
的方法来解决这个问题，例如
ways to work around it for example

683
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,533
用潮湿的捆绑物
with wet bundles

684
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:54,166
但这些都是非常早期的规格，而且是大量涌入的规格
but these are kind of specs that are really early and influx

685
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,266
但我们最近已经开始
but we've recently started

686
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:02,099
我们最近开始与浏览器的人接触，他们是直接在浏览器上工作的人。
got in contact with the browser folks who's

687
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,999
我们最近开始与直接在浏览器上工作的人接触，我们正试图
directly working on the browsers and we're trying to

688
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:09,466
交换意见，看看未来浏览器的哪些功能
exchange notes and see what future features in

689
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:11,466
浏览器中的哪些功能可以使我们受益
the browser could definishly benefit

690
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,299
我们可以利用这些功能来
feat that we could leverage to

691
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,066
改进
improve

692
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,866
另一件事是
and the other thing is

693
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:22,699
是啊是啊，所以我们最近一直在做相当多的
yeah yeah so so we've been recently doing quite a bit of

694
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:26,566
与从事浏览器工作的人进行沟通，以了解
communication with people working on browsers to see where

695
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:29,933
有什么潜在的方法可以解决这个问题？
what are the potential ways to address the spot on act

696
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,766
我想这可能是我最想解决的事情之一。
i think that is probably one of the things i

697
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,566
我想这可能是我最想解决的问题之一，但在短期内
i want to solve them most but in the short term

698
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:39,666
但在短期内，这是很困难的，所以我们有点儿
it's quite difficult so we're kind of

699
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,800
所以我们把希望寄托在浏览器的未来规格上
setting our hopes on future specs in the browser

700
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,333
所以我们把希望寄托在浏览器的未来规格上，希望能直接帮助我们解决这个问题
directly that maybe can help us with that

701
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,333
你们其他人呢？
what about the rest of y'all any

702
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,666
任何希望和未来
any hopes and futures

703
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,599
你们有什么希望吗？
that you're all are hoping for

704
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,999
我想，对不起
i think sorry

705
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,933
你可以继续下去
you can go ahead so down

706
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:08,166
好的
okay

707
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:13,333
所以我认为它的主要特点是快速和精简，所以
so i think the main characteristics of it is fast and lean so

708
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:19,599
我认为胜利会在这两方面走得更极端
i think victory will go more extreme on these two sides

709
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:22,733
例如，在胜利中，我们削减的
for example in victory we cut the

710
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:25,899
发表的大小在三分之一
published size in a third

711
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,600
和实际上与卷起三
and actually with the roll up three

712
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,933
发布，而在这个四
release and in this four

713
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:35,866
我们可以进一步削减安装尺寸，因为
we can further cut the install size because

714
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:41,699
Roll up将他们的浏览器绑定从mpm包中移除，而
roll up removed their browser bond from the mpm package and

715
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,366
另一方面
on the other

716
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,533
另一方面，Beat是非常简单的，所以嗯
hand beat is very simple so um

717
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,500
现在，当我们更多地关注我们内部的
now as we looking more inside our

718
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:55,666
内部复杂的城市，所以
internal complex city so

719
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,200
许多新的选项将被放入实验性标志中，并且
many of the new options will go into the experimental flag and

720
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,799
这将保持新的功能
that will keep the new features

721
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,900
更容易开始，而且
easier to start with and

722
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:15,333
我们可能会找到一种方法，将其整合到现有的选项中去
we might find a way to integrate it into the existing options

723
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:18,699
而不会让新用户感到困惑
without confusing new users

724
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:21,133
而这正是我所期待的
and that's what i was looking forward

725
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:26,966
是的，我认为你对我来说，主要是冲上去的。
yeah i think your mostly for me is punching up

726
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:30,166
所以一切都会保持不变，但会更好
so everything will stay the same but better

727
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:32,699
比如说像rollock free
so like rollock free for example

728
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,500
我们内部有变化，但你会有一些变化。
we change internally but you would a few it

729
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:37,366
这将是一个透明的变化
it would be a transparent change

730
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,500
有一些改进，从预先捆绑，我们
and there's some improvements from pre bundling that we

731
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,966
我想我们希望从
i guess we want to bring back from

732
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,600
早期的V树阿尔法时代
the early v tree alpha days

733
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,533
Maya的变化不应该影响你，它应该只是工作。
maya always change shouldn't affect you it should just work

734
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,133
神奇地
magically

735
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:55,366
所以你会得到盒装后的性能，你不需要
so you'll get the performance after box you don't have to

736
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,666
乱七八糟的冲突或什么的
mess around conflicts or anything

737
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,166
所以我想是的，到目前为止有一种未来的V。
so i guess yeah there's kind of future v so far

738
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:06,466
是的
yeah

739
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:08,599
是啊，我有点同意，而且
yeah i kind i kinda agreed and

740
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,666
对于我这样的人
for my kind person

741
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,400
个人的观点，我觉得
personal perspective i feel that

742
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:17,799
作为委员会，我们已经有了这个生态系统
as the committee we already have the ecosystem

743
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,966
我们已经有了那种
we already have that kind of

744
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:22,866
被批准，一个节拍本身是非常灵活的
being approved that a beat itself is being very flexible

745
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,700
既然我们有这么多的工具在上面，而且
and since there we have so many tools on top of it and

746
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,733
我觉得禁忌本身我们应该有点限制我们的范围，以
i think forbid itself we should kind limit our scope to

747
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:35,999
不引入那种真正的像
not introducing that really like

748
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,599
像新的功能，但我们
like new features but we

749
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,200
现在可以像把创新留给前面的工作，我们
could now like leave the innovations to the front work and we

750
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,533
我们不能已经看到，我们得到了很多新的
we can't already see that we got a lot of new

751
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,700
我们有一个朋友
we got a friend

752
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,900
我们得到了朋友的作品
we got the friend works

753
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,999
有很多新功能和新想法的大拇指
with a lot thumbs of new features and new ideas

754
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,466
而且已经在这个谈话中进行了，所以
and already going on in this talk and so

755
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,533
可以感觉到，对于维生素本身，我们应该继续做我们的
can feel that for vit itself we should keep doing our

756
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:06,899
工作，以像优化和使事情更快，或像
jobs to like optimize and to make things even faster or like

757
00:38:07,366 --> 00:38:10,566
改进事情本身，所以
improve the things itself so

758
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,600
我不觉得我们不会有像
i can't feel that we won't have like

759
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
那周要展示的主题演讲
keynote to showcase that week

760
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,700
我们不能有一大堆的新功能出现
we can't have a ton of new features coming in that

761
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,133
让人兴奋
get people excited

762
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,466
但我认为我内心的工作是保持事情
but i think the works inside of me to keep things

763
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:29,999
稳定，并保持事物的可维护性和快速性是
stable and to keep things like very maintainable and fast is

764
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,900
仍然是一项重要的工作，以
still a crucial job to

765
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,700
使它
make it

766
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,666
让整个社区都能
for the whole community to

767
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,600
使用一个东西
use a thing

768
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,100
哦
oh

769
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,500
这是有道理的，虽然
that makes sense although

770
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,266
我知道每个人在你说话的时候
i know everybody whenever you talk

771
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:49,699
ANTHONY都在等待测试，以弄清楚
anthony is waiting on beta breath to figure out

772
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:52,799
你被告知你接下来要创建什么图书馆，所以
what library are told you're gonna create next so

773
00:38:53,266 --> 00:38:54,333
我们很兴奋
we're excited

774
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,999
我觉得任何想看这个的人都应该
i feel like anybody who wants to see that we gotta just

775
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,166
继续关注你的github
keep watching your github

776
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,200
但你知道我喜欢这个 我是说我听到的关于V的事情
but you know i love that i mean the things that i hear

777
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,600
关于V和那种你们如何稳定和
about v and kind of how you all are stabilizing and

778
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
试图让它变得可维护，并且
trying to make it maintainable and

779
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,066
不做破坏性修改或很少做破坏性修改
no breaking changes or very little breaking changes

780
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,533
这些都是非常了不起的目标，我
are really amazing goals and i

781
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,066
你知道，我觉得这也是视图所做的，所以令人惊讶的是
you know i feel like that's also what view has done so surprise

782
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,566
令人惊讶的是，非常相似的团队在做同样的事情
surprise very similar team working on the same thing

783
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,099
但伊万，我知道你知道这些年来，你知道
but evan i know you know over the years you know

784
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,333
每当我和你谈起观点
whenever i talk to you about view

785
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,299
它总是像
it's always like

786
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,200
只是提高性能和改善事情，而且
just improving performance and improving things and

787
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:32,466
你知道的，就是不断地改进引擎盖下的东西
you know constantly like improving things under the hood

788
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:33,599
所以我很高兴听到
so it's great to hear

789
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,133
嗯，有点像一样的
um kind of like the same

790
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,466
我首先有一个经验
i have first an experience on

791
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,733
只是一个项目要经历不同的阶段
just a project going through different phases

792
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:43,066
因为当你
because when you're

793
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,566
刚开始的时候，你可以
just starting out you can

794
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:48,933
做任何你想做的事情，然后当你只有早期采用者的时候
do whatever you want then when you have only early adopters

795
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,166
你就可以把大的变化、大的改进
you can ship big changes big improvements

796
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,600
而不太在意
with while caring less about

797
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,500
破坏建立在它上面的东西，因为早期采用者
disrupting things built on top of it because early adopters

798
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:01,066
通常是
are typically

799
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,566
因为早期采用者通常对这种事情更加开放，但是
more open to that kind of thing but

800
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:06,299
当你达到一个临界质量时，你有很多的
when you reach a critical mass you have a lot of

801
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,700
你有更多的观众
you have a wider audience

802
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
你有一些人
you have people

803
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:13,133
他们只是在生产中使用你的东西来建造东西
who are just using your thing to build stuff in production

804
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:13,933
和
and

805
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,933
有一大群用户，他们
there are big group of users who

806
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:17,933
对他们来说，首要任务是
for them first

807
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:21,066
稳定性是他们的首要任务，他们不希望事情突然中断。
priority is stability they don't want things to suddenly break

808
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:25,066
而在某一时刻
and there will be a point where

809
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,766
你解决了这个问题
you are solving the problem

810
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:31,299
足够好的时候，稳定性在某种程度上成为
well enough that stability in a way becomes

811
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,199
一个真正重要的价值
a really important value

812
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,866
的重要价值
for the thing to uphold

813
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,600
所以我认为壮举是在一个
so i think feat is in a

814
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,666
过渡时期
transition period where

815
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:45,699
我们想从本质上把我们的焦点带回来一点儿
we want to essentially bring back our focus a little bit

816
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,066
而不是考虑好
instead of thinking about okay

817
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:50,399
下一件大事是什么 下一个新事物是什么
what's the next big thing what's the next new thing

818
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,166
我们会说好吧
we're going to say okay

819
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,199
如何使目前的事情变得更好
how to make the current things better

820
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:58,399
如何让它保持同样的工作方式，但更快更精简
how to keep it working the same way but faster leaner

yeah and yes saying to you two

960
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:46,399
和所有在现场的版主
and to all the moderators that were there

961
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:47,499
围绕着这一天
around the day

962
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,333
其实主持工作并没有那么多车，因为
it was not that car actually to moderate because

963
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:55,166
每个人都像在给别人送花一样
everybody was like sending flowers to each others exactly

964
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,199
我说的是对的
what ii was saying right

965
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,066
当你进来的时候
as you were coming in

966
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:58,666
我觉得每个人都是那么善良
i was like everyone was so kind

967
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:01,066
我觉得我们真的不需要很多的节制
i feel like we didn't really need a lot of moderation

968
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:01,799
这很了不起
which was amazing

969
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,900
但我要感谢所有的版主，这真是不可思议。
but i thank you to all the moderators that was incredible

970
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,166
是的
yeah

971
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:08,266
是的，很高兴看到
yeah it was really nice to see

972
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:12,299
很高兴看到白地在一天之内就变成了一个空间
like whitland converted like in one day as a space

973
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,733
所有的社区
where all the communities

974
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:16,199
就像我刚才说的，在
get together like i was saying there in the

975
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,366
在小麦小组中，现在
in the wheat panel now

976
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:19,733
我不知道是什么时候开始的固体谈话
that i don't know like when was the solid talk

977
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:22,266
像所有的固体雾室
like all the solid fog room

978
00:47:22,733 --> 00:47:23,899
来到了这个房间
came to the room

979
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,133
是的
and yeah

980
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:27,333
我说，这也是像它如何
i said that too is like how it

981
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,966
它是如何把所有这些社区聚集在一起的
beat really brings all of these communities together

982
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,699
感觉就像一个大家庭，我们都很友好
and it felt like a family like we were all being nice

983
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,500
没有框架战争，只是
there were no framework wars it was just

984
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,133
我们所有的人都很善良，都在一起
all of us being kind and being together

985
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:38,366
这感觉真的很好
which felt really good

986
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,366
是的
yeah

987
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:43,133
是的是的，正如一些发言人所说，我认为这是
yeah yeah and as some of the speakers said like i think this is

988
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:47,799
我认为这对共同制度的未来是一件好事。
like this is a good thing for the future of the co system

989
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,499
就像所发生的那样
like what happened like

990
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,466
也像埃文斯说的
also like evans said

991
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:56,399
现在，像它真的很有趣，看到
now that like isit's really interesting to see

992
00:47:56,733 --> 00:48:00,666
比如说不是每两个星期公布一次
like not like once announcement every two weeks

993
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:02,933
但像很多人使用它
but like a lot of people use it

994
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,666
这个特殊的日子是一个艰难的日子
this particular day as a hard day

995
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,533
为他们做一个公告
for them to do an announcement

996
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:09,999
就像来自ESTAGLITZ的人，在工作上有那么多的好处
like from estaglitz that comes in working so much

997
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,466
躺在床上
to actually lounge

998
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,100
冷流在此
cold flow in this

999
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,099
如果你在听第二部分
like if you are listening for the second

1000
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,933
如果你听的是第二部分，就像冷流不存在一样，你会了解到它的。
part like cold flow doesn't exist you're going to get to know it

1001
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:20,099
就像没有破坏者一样
like no spoilers

1002
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,466
是的，没有，现在没有破坏者
yeah no no spoiler now

1003
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,199
但也像一本故事书
but also like a storybook

1004
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:27,533
实际上是在宣布Simpono将发生什么事
actually announcing what is going to happen with simpono

1005
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:30,499
或者像卷轴三Lucas
or like the rollap three lucas

1006
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,400
他们就像在选择，他们这个样的像重大的
they're like choosing that they this kind of like significant

1007
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,466
不像是
not like is

1008
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:38,066
为拉帕和维塔做的，我想我知道的。
making it for lapa and vita lot closer i think i know

1009
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:40,599
我看到有人在询问股票的情况，哦
i saw people like asking for stock at one point oh

1010
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,566
我想，我们刚刚发布了候选作品，你们要放慢脚步。
i'm like we just hit release candidate you guys slow your roll

1011
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:47,099
我们不能让所有东西都在今天发布，对吗？
a little bit we can't have everything released today right

1012
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:54,066
是的，是的，但它也是达到了达到了股票是
yeah yeah but it also was reach reach stock was

1013
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,366
难以置信，也像第一部分，当
incredible also like the first part when

1014
00:48:58,266 --> 00:48:59,199
他说的是
he was talking about

1015
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,300
就像这个比喻说的那样，我们的新结构被打败了
like this analogy of beat us the fresh structure

1016
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:04,866
对生态系统来说，我觉得
like for the ecosystem i seem

1017
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,499
我觉得这是很有道理的
like that that's quite on point

1018
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,733
听起来真的非常有趣
it was really really interesting to hear

1019
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:10,333
我同意是的
i agree to yeah

1020
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:13,266
我认为所有的演讲都是经过深思熟虑的
i thought all of the talks were just so well thought out

1021
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,866
这真的是令人惊奇的一天，而且
it was really an amazing day and

1022
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,500
如果你只是来参加的话，你是很难得的。
you were inferior treat if you're just joining in

1023
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:20,699
是啊是啊是啊
yeah yeah yeah

1024
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,766
我不知道我们有多少时间，但是...
totally so so yeah i don't know how much time we have like but

1025
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,900
你应该
you should

1026
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:29,066
你应该留在这里
like stay around now like

1027
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,666
有一件事是很重要的，我想也是要分享的
one thing that is important i think like to share also

1028
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:37,999
现在，像我们做了很多的噪音
now now like we did a lot of noise

1029
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:41,966
当我们开始的时候，很多社区都加入了
when we are started so a lot of communities join

1030
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,466
但现在像
but now like

1031
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,733
社区的很大一部分人正在加入
a big part of the community is joining

1032
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:49,299
所以如果你邀请他们
so it would be nice if you invite them

1033
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,866
来这里
to came here

1034
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:55,066
所以，如果你能分享像Vitcom这样的链接，那就太好了。
so like if you share like the link that is like vitcom

1035
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:58,133
vicon org是睫毛生活
vicon org is lash life

1036
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,000
这是一种像他们的链接，你必须分享
that is kind of like their link that you have to share

1037
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:02,499
在那里你将会
there you are going to

1038
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:03,899
就像实际上
like actually

1039
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,600
我们将一起解释所有这些
we are going to be together like explaining all these

1040
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,966
我知道这只是要重新播放一遍。
i know it's just going to replay over again

1041
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,533
是的
yes

1042
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:12,999
所以也许我们现在不应该解释那么多
so maybe we shouldn't explain that much now

1043
00:50:13,766 --> 00:50:14,466
但是，是的
but yeah

1044
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:18,899
我们没有设置这个问题 我觉得这很重要
we didn't set there that that i think it's important now

1045
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:24,199
这12个小时的很大一部分不仅是会谈
like a big part of these twelve hours was not only the talks

1046
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,666
而且还在这个法庭上一起观看
but was also watching it together in this court

1047
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,866
和所有这些类似的渠道，所以我看到像
and in all these like channels so i see like

1048
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,166
走出去
go out

1049
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,266
邀请其他人，所以你现在得到了同样的经验
invite others and like so you get that same experience now

1050
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,699
是的，我
yeah i

1051
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:39,333
完全同意，我
completely agree and i

1052
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,666
是的，我完全同意，我向大家提到了
was mentioning to everyone

1053
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,766
如果你有一个最喜欢的
that if you have a favorite

1054
00:50:41,766 --> 00:50:43,466
谈话或你真正喜欢的东西
talk or something that you really liked about

1055
00:50:43,466 --> 00:50:44,399
今天，请确保你在
today make sure you're

1056
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,866
在Viet Comp的标签
tagging at viet comp

1057
00:50:45,866 --> 00:50:48,733
使用标签 viet comp 并在twitter上分享。
using hashtag viet comp and sharing that on twitter

1058
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:50,266
就像让更多的人加入
like getting more people in

1059
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,133
我不相信有两万个注册者
i can't believe twenty thousand registrations

1060
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,599
这真是不可思议
it's just incredible

1061
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,733
是啊，实际上人们现在还在继续抵制她 是的
yeah and actually the people continue to resist her now yeah

1062
00:50:58,733 --> 00:51:01,466
所以我们看到了这个数字，我就像个小鸡一样飞了起来。
so we were seeing the number i was just chicken up and over

1063
00:51:01,733 --> 00:51:02,533
是的 是的
yeah yeah

1064
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,800
我想应该是23点5分
i think it's like a twenty three point five

1065
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:09,366
现在的注册人数和
k now registrations and

1066
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,933
如果我没查错的话
if i check correctly

1067
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:11,666
有像
there were like

1068
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:14,999
一千名新成员加入了Vidland的讨论区
one thousand new members to vidland to the discourt

1069
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,966
就像一千名新加入的人
like one thousand new people that join

1070
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,766
维德兰，这是
vidland that that's

1071
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:21,266
这是很重要的，因为像其中一个
quite important because like one of the

1072
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:23,766
不让会议
ideas of not making the conference

1073
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:26,066
在一个单独的空间
in a separate space

1074
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:27,766
我们可以说是一个单独的聊天室
let's say like a separate chat

1075
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,166
的想法是，让我们使用vidland，所以
was the idea of like let's use vidland so

1076
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,066
所有这些运动实际上是和我们在一起的，比如
all this movement actually stays with us like

1077
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,766
希望今天在这里工作的一些人
hopefully some of the people that work here today

1078
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:42,566
希望今天在这里工作的一些人能够在这个社区工作，并且留在这里。

00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,533
然后参与进来，让更多的人

1080
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:47,899
进入你的社区 是的

1081
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,366
我完全同意这一点
i completely agree with that

1082
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:51,566
满足你的社区，他们在哪里，所以现在
and meeting your community where they're at so now

你有所有这些社区成员在那里

他们可以找到
they can find

1085
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:58,999
帮助，让他们知道去哪里找这些东西。
help and get they know where to go and look for those things

1086
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,366
我知道你提到
i know you mentioned

1087
00:52:00,366 --> 00:52:02,666
我知道你曾经提到过，可能会有一个不和谐的阶段
at one point that there might be a discord stage

1088
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:03,699
我不想把你放在
i didn't want to put you on the

1089
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,100
我不想把你放在这个位置上
spot

1090
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,866
但我提到了关于这个问题 是会发生还是
but i mentioned something about that is that going to happen or

1091
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,133
让我们来看看我们的情况如何
let's let's check how we are

1092
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,966
在每个人的力量中，都有一个小神志不清的人
in everybody's power a little delirious

1093
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,066
是的，在12个小时内，如果我们现在不做的话
yeah in twelve hour more like if we don't do it now

1094
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:18,899
我们可以在一个星期内完成它
we can do it in one week

1095
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:20,399
但是，是的，就像
but but yeah like

1096
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:22,666
之后留下
stay after

1097
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,900
就像会议在下半场结束后结束一样
like the conference is over over like after the second half

1098
00:52:26,966 --> 00:52:30,866
如果我们在一起，我们决定在这个好时机
and if we are together and we decide at this good moment

1099
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:33,899
就像和社区讨论一样，让我们来做吧
like talk with the community let's do it

1100
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:35,666
好的，听起来不错
okay sounds good

1101
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,566
而且也许
and maybe

1102
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:37,599
未来的活动
the ones in the future

1103
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,333
你们是否有活动，并将其发布在讨论区？
like do you have events that you post in the discord

1104
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,066
人们可以去看看
that people can go and see

1105
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,766
就像我知道Vit Comp现在就有这个活动，但是
like i know vit comp has the event in there right now but

1106
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:48,533
你能不能发布一下，比如有什么
would you post like are there

1107
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,866
未来的事件或重复发生的事件，Vit Land Discord
future events or reoccurring events that the vit land discord

1108
00:52:51,866 --> 00:52:52,666
有
has

1109
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:56,466
这是我第一次参加这样的活动
like this is the first kind of like oh

1110
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,400
我们在这个法庭上所做的活动。
ohofficial let's say like event that we did in this court

1111
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:03,966
但是，也许像给像
but maybe like given like the

1112
00:53:04,366 --> 00:53:06,199
但鉴于这种反应
reaction that this is having

1113
00:53:06,466 --> 00:53:08,933
也许我们应该多做一些
maybe we should do more often like

1114
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,400
我知道，比如说在天体的
i know for example like in the astro

1115
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:13,766
不和谐，也许在这个世界上也是
discord and maybe in this world also

1116
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,966
你有像每两个星期一次或东西，你得到的
you have like once every two weeks or something that you get

1117
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:21,133
像在一起，只是与社区的人交谈
like together and just talk with the community

1118
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,533
所以也许我们应该这样做，比如
so maybe we should do that like

1119
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,600
我们应该这样做，比如Asher和Redwood都是这样做的。
asher does that and redwood does that this belt

1120
00:53:26,766 --> 00:53:27,766
团队不这样做
team doesn't do it

1121
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:28,799
但我们已经讨论过
but we've talked about

1122
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,966
但我们已经讨论过这样做，因为我认为这对于
doing that because i think that's really good for

1123
00:53:30,966 --> 00:53:32,266
建立社区参与
building community involvement

1124
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:32,866
特别是在
especially with

1125
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:34,933
这些开放源码的东西，所以
these open source things so

1126
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:36,099
我想这是
i think that is

1127
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,866
我认为这对这些社区来说是非常有益的
really beneficial for these communities to have that

1128
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:40,366
因此，这将是非常酷的
so that would be really cool

1129
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:42,599
这其实是个好主意，我觉得
that's actually a good idea i think

1130
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,800
我们现在可以讨论
we can discuss now

1131
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,366
就像在接下来的12个小时里
like in this next twelve hour

1132
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:48,466
某个时候醒来，讨论这些其他的
wake up sometime to discuss about these other

1133
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:52,333
我还要睡八个小时呢
meta things what i'm gonna sleep for about eight hours

1134
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,666
我想我也会这样做的，但是
i think i will do too like but

1135
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,500
像蓝色的安东尼汽水
like blue antony soda

1136
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:00,266
像有很多像Evan一样的人
like there's a lot of like evan

1137
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:02,733
有很多人都在拍摄工作，所以
like there's a lot of people that shots work and up so

1138
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:07,566
比如说会有一些主题和版主的交流
like there will be some like exchange of themesand moderators

1139
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,766
然后，我们，我们回来了
and then we that we were back

1140
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:12,799
我想就像采取一些
and i wanted to just like take some

1141
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:15,899
时间来再次感谢
time to thanks again like

1142
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,800
你将会看到对我们的感谢，但是
you're going to see thanks to us like but

1143
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,066
但是，这很好，就像所有这些发生
but it's good like all these happen

1144
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:23,299
也是因为首先像演讲者，像你
also because first like the speakers like you

1145
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,533
你说过，这些讲座很精彩，因为

1146
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:26,599
他们真的很像
they really were like

1147
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,800
有一些像
there were some that like

1148
00:54:27,866 --> 00:54:29,966
就像好莱坞的那种制作
were like hollywood kind of production

1149
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,133
就像它只是它只是惊人的所以

谢谢你，非常感谢

1163
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,966
这也是一种像将被重复作为会议结束的
this is also kind of like going to be repeated as the end

1164
00:55:05,966 --> 00:55:07,966
会议的结束，所以
