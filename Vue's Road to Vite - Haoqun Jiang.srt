1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,566
大家好，我是来自ugs团队的Hautchington。
hi everyone I'm hautchington from the ugs team

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,799
今天我演讲的题目是 "通往小麦的道路"。
today my talk title is fills road to wheat

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,366
我将会谈论
and I'm going to talk

4
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:14,366
关于新的ugs开发经验
about the new ugs developing experience

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,499
以小麦为中心
centered around wheat

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,333
首先让我快速介绍一下自己
let me quickly introduce myself first

7
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:25,333
我是view和vit两个团队的成员。
I'm a member of both the view and vit

8
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:29,199
卡团队的成员，是一名全职的开放歌曲开发者
card teams as a full time open songs developer

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,266
我的主要工作是为vgs开发曲子。
my main focus is on the tulings for vgs

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,766
所以
so

11
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,399
我维护并参与了几个与vgs项目有关的项目
I maintain and contribute to several projects related

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,600
我的主要工作是为vgs做准备，所以我维护和贡献了几个与vgs项目脚手架和捆绑有关的项目。
to vgs project scaffolding and bundling

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,866
最明显的是view cri fit和create view。
most notably view cri fit and create view

14
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,966
我的礼物用户名是在苏打茶
my gift username is at soda tea

15
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,266
我的微博账号是我的手机号
and my twitter handle is my phone name

16
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,666
在hotchinjang
at hotchinjang

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,966
今年早些时候
earlier this year

18
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:58,899
我们把好的老家的coi项目
we put the good oldville coi project

19
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,333
进入维护模式
into maintenance mode

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,866
意味着我们将不再
meaning that we will no longer

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,500
积极为其添加新功能
actively add new features to it

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
但它只是运回了一些修复功能
but it's only shipped back fixes

23
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,399
现在的官方建议是
now the official recommendation

24
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,666
是使用下面的命令来创建新的
is to use the following command to create new

25
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:16,866
project mpm create view at 3
projects mpm create view at 3

26
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:20,733
它比UCI要轻巧得多
it is much more lightweight than UCI

27
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,533
不需要额外的
requires no additional

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,466
全局安装工具，接受mpm和node
global installation of tools acceptful mpm and node

29
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,999
而且它一直是最新的
and it is always up to date

30
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,799
呃，最近我们还设法将其纳入
uh recently we also managed to incorporate it

31
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,766
纳入官方饲料模板
into the official feed templates

32
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,966
所以现在当你运行
so now when you run the

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,900
mpn create vitad latest 命令
mpn create vitad latest command

34
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:47,499
你就可以看到 呃
you will you can also see the uh

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,333
一个自定义的创建视图选项
a customized with create view option

36
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:54,399
旁边还有两个简约的
in the job John alongside the 2 minimalistic

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,133
模板。
templates provided by create wit

38
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,933
它将创建一个完全相同的项目
it will create the exact same project

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
和创建视图命令一样
as the create view command

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,666
和基于小麦的空载
and the airborne based on wheat

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,533
所以在今天的谈话中
so in today's talk

42
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,099
我将尝试为你回答这些问题
I'll try to answer these questions for you

43
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,666
首先，为什么我们的视图团队
first why do we the view team

44
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,266
决定从
decide to switch from

45
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:23,299
vapac到创建view和vit
vapac to create view and vit

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,700
究竟有哪些不同的方法？
exactly what are the different approaches

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,733
视图调整生态系统所采取的方法
the view tuning ecosystem is taken

48
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,066
在其中的一个领域
in an area of it

49
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,499
我们可以期待什么更有趣的新功能
what more interesting new features can we expect

50
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,366
在不久的将来，在
in the near future in the

51
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:37,999
视图生态系统
view ecosystem

52
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,133
第一个也是最显著的变化
the first and most notable change

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,166
是将我们的生态系统
is to turn our ecosystem

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,600
摆脱网络包的束缚
away from web pack

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,966
我不得不说，这需要一些勇气
I have to say that it takes some courage

56
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,266
和挣扎，我们
and struggle for us

57
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,733
做出这个决定
to make this decision

58
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,066
因为这样做，我们是在
because by doing so we are

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,533
基本上放弃了
essentially dropping

60
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,799
我们以前在网络包方面所做的大量努力
lots of our previous efforts devoted to the web pack

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,766
生态系统
ecosystem

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,500
但
but the

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,133
但现在维生素生态系统已经越来越成熟了
vit ecosystem is now getting more and more mature

64
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,299
我们相信这是值得的
and we believe it's worth it

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,733
效益是非常明显的，令人印象深刻
the benefits are very obvious and impressive

66
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:16,899
我们都知道
we all know that

67
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:20,133
合适的步骤服务器比白包快得多
fit step server is way faster than white packs

68
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,366
准确地说，是完全公平地结束
to be precise to end completely fair

69
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,266
好吧，这实际上是可能的
well it is actually possible

70
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,699
获得
to get the

71
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,866
几乎相同的性能，因为适合与湿包
nearly the same performance as fit with wet pack

72
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,766
只要你有
as long as you have

73
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,599
配置了
configured the

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,666
原生的比较工具，如swc或BS build
native comparison tools such as swc or BS build

75
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,399
而且你有一个非常好的
and you have a very good

76
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,199
现金考虑，而且是温暖的启动
cash considerations and it is a warm startup

77
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,866
然而，要获得所有这些配置是非常困难的
however it is extremely hard to get all these

78
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,266
配置的正确性
configurations right

79
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,099
而且它还会有大量的
and it will quite tons of

80
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:57,899
辩护
defendancies

81
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,799
同时，在适合
meanwhile in fit

82
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,566
良好的性能是开箱即用的
the good performance is out of the box

83
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,533
你不需要额外配置任何东西
you don't have to configure anything additionally

84
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,733
此外，当它涉及到热模型的更换
besides when it comes to the hot model replacement

85
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,066
功能时，时间
feature the time

86
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:17,733
访问执行的复杂性是恒定的
complexity of the visit implementation is constant

87
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,566
而网络黑客是专业的身体帐户
while web hacks is professional to the body account

88
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,299
因此，当项目增长的
so when the project grows the

89
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:26,766
部分现代替换在网络包
part modern replacement in web pack

90
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,933
变得更慢，而这是设计上的问题
gets slower and this is by design

91
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,999
这意味着web pack永远无法赶上它。
meaning that web pack can never catch up with it

92
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,466
它的另一个好处是它的简单性
another benefit of it is its simplicity

93
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,300
它的配置格式是简单而直观的
the configuration format of it is easy and intuitive

94
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:49,366
这样我们就不需要另一个抽象层了
so that we don't need another layer of abstraction

95
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,066
像web pack链一样，让用户轻松
like web pack chain to let the users easily

96
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,066
获得他们想要的配置，以适应
get their desired configurations in fit

97
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:00,266
甚至对于生态系统包的提供
and even for ecosystem package offers

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,333
它更容易从vitcom中扩展
it is easier to extend from the vitcom

99
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,933
比从wetpack
than from the wetpack

100
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:05,733
车
car

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,966
例如，它是一个
for example it is a

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,566
例如，在wetpack中，普遍承认的设计PT是
universally acknowledged design PT in wetpack that

103
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:17,266
它不应该在API中同时有负载和插头
it shouldn't have both the load and plug in API

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,066
因为这带来了两个问题
because this brings 2 problems

105
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:23,866
第一
first

106
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:28,966
用户可能不知道该使用哪个API
users might not know which API to use

107
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,966
有时他们甚至可能
sometimes they might even

108
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,099
一开始就选错了
have chosen the wrong one at first

109
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,766
比如es linksof loader
like the es linksof loader

110
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:42,499
后来被变成了es inter webpack pagan
was later turned into es inter webpack pagan

111
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,266
因为autos发现plagan的apis
because the autos found that the plagan apis

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,700
更适合于我们的使用情况和
are more suitable for the use case of usand

113
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,199
而有时
and sometimes

114
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,666
我们可能同时需要负载和
we may need both loads and

115
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,366
插件apis来实现一个单一的
the plugin apis to achieve one single

116
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,666
功能
functionality

117
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,133
这就是视图加载器的情况
that's the case for view loader

118
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:07,133
尽管它的名字里有世界加载器的字样
even though it has the world loader in its name

119
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,100
用户仍然需要使用视图加载器
users still have to use the view loader

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,933
攻击同一软件包中的出口
attacking export from the same package

121
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,899
与视图加载器一起
together with the view loader

122
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:20,699
来制作一个导出视图的单文件组件
to make an export view single file component

123
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,133
这些都不再是
these are no longer

124
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,966
在Viet和角色上的问题，因为
problems in Viet and the role up because

125
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:30,099
他们只有一种方式可以从时钟上扩展
they only have one way to extend from the clock

126
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,100
那就是插件系统
that's the plugin system

127
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,066
最后，关于小麦
lastly as of wheat

128
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,733
小麦的第三大创造
the 3rd major creation of wheat

129
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,200
我们相信，小麦已经足够成熟
we believe that wheat is mature

130
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,966
我们相信小麦已经足够成熟，并且已经为严肃的用例做好了准备
enough and more than ready for serious use cases

131
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,733
因为尽管它很简单
because with all its simplicity

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,466
它仍然有足够的力量调用
it still has a power enough call

133
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:56,199
它已准备好与许多内置的集成系统一起使用
it is ready for use with many built integrations

134
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,766
它使用滚动的战斗测试
it uses roll up the battle test

135
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,333
用于生产捆绑
for production bundling

136
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,933
当然，还有
and of course

137
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:10,766
超级性能的债务服务器是它的一个
the super performance debt server is one of its

138
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,999
最具代表性的功能
most iconic feature

139
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:17,866
嘿
hey

140
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:22,799
而且它默认启用了静态资产处理功能
and it has static assets handling enabled by default

141
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,400
不需要额外的用户考虑
no extra user consideration is required

142
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:29,966
所以这使得feat更像wetpack
so this makes feat more like wetpack

143
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,999
更像stui而不是webpack
more like stui than webpack

144
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:36,799
而
the

145
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,966
这也是我们改用feed的另一个原因
that's another reason for us to switch to feed

146
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:43,866
而不是创建另一个层
directly instead of creating another layer

147
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,200
而不是创建另一层，即卡片式的feed cri或其他东西
card feed cri or something else

148
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:51,699
而对于更复杂的用例
and for more sophisticated use cases

149
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,500
如兄弟的兼容性问题
such as brother compatibility issues

150
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,733
和单元测试解决方案
and unit testing solutions

151
00:07:56,966 --> 00:08:00,866
Fitz已经有了一个丰富的生态系统
Fitz has already has a rich ecosystem

152
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,566
它有第一方插件
it has first party plugins

153
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,733
为圣经转述，它有第三方旅游
for bible transpiration and it has 3rd party tours

154
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,499
像适合测试的
like fit test for

155
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,600
单元测试
unit testings

156
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,466
因此，菲茨现在的功能是与
so fit is now in feature parity with

157
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,600
感受你的眼睛，主要是
feels your eye mostly

158
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,599
而且
and

159
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,866
这使我们对转换更有信心
that makes us more confident in a switching

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,466
这是一个混合的祝福，它是一个
it is a mixed blessing that it is a

161
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:35,133
它是一个全新一代的网络工具
completely new generation of web tools

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
我们可以利用这个机会采取不同的
we can take the opportunity to take a different

163
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,566
我们可以借此机会采取不同的方法来解决一些问题，而这些问题
approach of some of the issues that

164
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,066
是不可能的
wasn't possible

165
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,300
以前在pcl和y pack中是不可能的
previously in pcl and y pack

166
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,466
我们放弃了对许多反模式的关注
we dropped spot for many anti patterns

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,266
例如
for example

168
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:04,499
esm和cgs代码不再被允许混合使用
esm and cgs code are no longer allowed to be mixed

169
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,199
在用户项目中
in user projects

170
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,966
你不能使用模块
you cannot use module

171
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,699
输出和导入语句在同一模块中使用。
exports and import statements in the single

172
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,333
在同一个模块中使用
in the same module

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,866
当然，只允许使用cgs代码的依赖性
of course cgs only code are allowed in dependence

174
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:21,666
但
but

175
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,000
你的项目代码会因为这个限制而变得更干净
your project code will be cleaner with this limitation

176
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,966
至于视图的困扰
as of the view plaguing of it

177
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,333
我们现在强制要求
we now force

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,466
明确的扩展，当你从一个
explicit extensionswhen you import from a

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,766
的时候，我们会强制使用明确的扩展名，因为这样可以使
few single file components because that makes the

180
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,299
与其他工具的整合更容易
integration with other tools easier

181
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,966
要求，并且类型脚本可以识别
asking towards and the type script can recognize the

182
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,799
识别少数单一文件的组件
few single file components earlier

183
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,966
这在将来会减少问题。
and that would be less problematic in the future

184
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,266
适合不仅是
fit does not only

185
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,133
在技术问题上采取了不同的方法
take a different approach on technical issues

186
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:07,133
它还在许多层面上改善了项目的管理
it also improves the project management on many levels

187
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:11,399
它现在有一个可预测的发布套件
it now has a predictable release kit

188
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:12,733
这就是
that is

189
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,899
每年至少有一个主要的版本，这就是它的形状
it's what shapes at least one major version every year

190
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,066
以便与注释js版本保持一致
to be in line with note js versions

191
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:26,933
因此，每年都会有一个生命末期的版本出现。
so every year this would drop a spot for end of life

192
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,066
而不是js版本
not js versions

193
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:32,899
今年，Fitz jobs fit 3被删除
this year Fitz jobs fit 3 dropped

194
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,900
非礼服的位置12
spots for non dress 12

195
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,266
而明年的2023年
and next year 2023

196
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:40,533
适合非礼服14的下降支持
fits what dropped support for non dress 14

197
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,966
小规模的频繁和
the small frequent and

198
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,566
可预测的发布节奏
predictable release cadence

199
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,899
也使得
also makes

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,933
每个主要版本的迁移路径更加顺畅
the migration path of each major version smoother

201
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,966
它将有更少的
it will have fewer

202
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,999
破坏性变化
breaking changes in each major releases

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
所以你不会再看到
so you will no longer see

204
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,999
一长串的
the long list of

205
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,200
迁移指南中的一长串破坏性变化
breaking changes in the migration guide

206
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,766
而且这种
and this

207
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,666
迁移的便利性也得到了维塔公司的保证。
ease of migration is also guaranteed by the vita

208
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,399
生态系统cip库
ecosystem cip repository

209
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,733
每一个版本
with every release

210
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,966
适应性是通过所有主要参与者的测试
fit is tested with all is the major players

211
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,133
的主要参与者进行测试。
in the ecosystem

212
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,199
如果你正在使用vita
and if you are using vita

213
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:30,766
与一个包装器或一个隐喻或其他东西
with a wrapper or a metaphor or something else

214
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,866
它们将被
they will be

215
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,500
保证在发布前可以使用
guaranteed to be useable before the release

216
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:41,199
所以迁移的路径会更顺畅
so the migration pathis smoother

217
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:45,666
在从Bill CIA到Vita的过渡中
in a transition from Bill CIA to veet

218
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,966
我们还利用这个机会
we've also taken this opportunity

219
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,466
解除了一些复杂的功能
to decapo some complex features

220
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,499
从主工具中分离出来
from the main tool

221
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:55,999
在View Cri
in view cri

222
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,199
我们过去有概念性的颜色生成器
we used to have the concept color generators

223
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,966
是特殊的插件，用于
which are special plugins used to

224
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,666
创建或修改用户项目中的文件
create or modify files in a user project

225
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,766
这些生成器通常是
these generators are often

226
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:11,666
彼此紧密结合在一起
tightly coupled with each other

227
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:16,166
例如，类型脚本 begin
for example the type script begin

228
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:17,999
是用来
is used to

229
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,466
修改
modify

230
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:24,466
从coi服务包中创建的javascript文件
javascript files created from the coi service package

231
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,533
创建的javascript文件，但对
but has special handling for

232
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,333
创建的文件进行特殊处理。
files created from the

233
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,133
路由器插件
router plugin

234
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,699
所以这使得这些
so that makes these

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,366
生成器难以长期维护
generators hard to maintain in the long run

236
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,533
现在
now that

237
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,799
我们正在创建新的工具
we are creating new tools

238
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,533
所以我们决定创建一个专门的脚手架工具
so we decided to create a dedicated scaffolding tools

239
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,566
为每一个用例创建一个专门的脚手架工具
for each of these use cases

240
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:54,366
我们已经创建了一个视图
we have created a view

241
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,366
其中我有所有的
which I have all the

242
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:59,733
视图项目的基本必需品
basic necessities for our view project

243
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:00,966
和
and

244
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,099
对于那些使用自己的模板的人来说，他们使用的是
for those who are using their own templates are using

245
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,066
所有基于网络包的项目
all the web pack based projects

246
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,166
我们有几个
we have thefew

247
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:16,133
斜线在冲突包中创建，用于
slash creates in the conflict package that are used

248
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,500
只用于为你创建我们的链接配置
for only creating the us link configurations for you

249
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,733
如果你想拥有自己的项目模板
and if you want to have your own project template

250
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,533
我认为这是一个不错的选择
I think it is a good choice to

251
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:32,333
如果你想拥有你自己的项目模板，我认为这是一个很好的选择，创建github仓库作为模板并使用
create github repositories as templates and use

252
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:36,333
门来为你下载这些模板。
the gates to download these templates for you

253
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,499
视图服务中的另一种类型的插件服务插件
another type of plugin in view service service plugins

254
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,400
这些都是用来扩展web back的插件。
these are plugins used to extend the web back

255
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
冲突，从
conflict from the

256
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,300
调用coi服务和coi插件
call coi service and coi plugins

257
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,266
现在，这个节拍更容易配置和扩展了
now that beat is easier to configure and extend from

258
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:02,299
呃，我们不再需要另一个抽象层了，所以
uh we no longer need another layer of abstractions so

259
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,366
我们不再需要另一个抽象层，因此，不再需要封一个服务园
no more seal a service park in

260
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:11,499
你可以只在项目中使用普通的珠子。
you can just use plain bead bargains in a project

261
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,766
好了，现在让我们仔细看看每个珊瑚的
okay now let's take a closer look at each of the coral

262
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,766
填补coi插件，看看
fill coi plugins and see

263
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,999
我们在脚下的生态系统里有什么？
what we've got in the feet ecosystem

264
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,133
首先让我们从Yes Clint插件开始
first let's start with the yes Clint plugin

265
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,566
yeastint pagan是用来帮助用户
the yeastint pagan was used to help users

266
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,533
配置yeastint
configure yeastints

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,166
在他们的项目中，并
in their projects and

268
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,133
在项目编译过程中链接
linked the

269
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:45,133
文件在项目编译过程中
files during project compilation

270
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,699
为配置路径
for the configuration path

271
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:50,699
我们已经创建了一个新的旅游，你可以调用
we've created a new tour and you can call the

272
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:55,199
创建一些斜线的小配置。
mpn create a few slash yes little config

273
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,733
来帮助你在面试项目中配置是的
to help youconfigure yes in interview projects

274
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,366
呃，包括配合
uh that includes fits

275
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,466
不仅在配合项目中，而且在
not only in fit projects but also in

276
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,333
网络包项目和或在
web pack projects and or in

277
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
uh 一些ci项目
uh few ci projects

278
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:19,333
至于项目编译过程中的链接部分
as for the linking during project compilation parts

279
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:20,999
我们现在发现
we now find

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,066
我们现在发现，这并不是一个理想的链接方式，因为
that it is not the ideal way to do linking because

281
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,533
它损害了编译性能
it hurts the compilation performance

282
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,066
和
and

283
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:34,066

285
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,866
我们不建议你只使用你的id
we not recommend you to just use your id

286
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,899
或编辑功能
or editor feature

287
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,366
来使用升级，而不是
to use the escalate instead of

288
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,099
使用捆绑的插件
use a bundle of plugin

289
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,499
而至于顶部的脚本则是
and as for the top script bargain

如果你想进行类型检查
if you want type checking

294
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,100
我们也建议你使用你的

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,000
编辑器或

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,266
和IGES
iges and

297
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,966
如果你想在命令行中进行类型检查，那么
if you want to do the type check in command line then

298
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,699
你可以安装votsc
you can install the votsc

299
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,466
包。
package separately

300
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,133
当然，如果你确实想看到
of course if you do want to see the

301
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,599
链接和类型检查的结果

303
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,099
有1个
there is 1/3 party

304
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,400
null
plugin called wheat plugging checker

305
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,299
null
that runs these tools

306
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,533
null
in our walker thread

307
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,299
null
which is non blocking

308
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
null
and the result will be shown in the

309
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,933
null
plaza era of a lake

310
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:54,466
null
just like what we've got in the UCI in the past

311
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,133
null
as for the unit's testing solutions

312
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,699
null
actually we are not satisfied with any of our

313
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,666
null
previous solutions

314
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,566
null
Jesse is a great tool

315
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,900
null
um but the biggest

316
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,533
null
problem of it is that it doesn't

317
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,666
null
share confusions with the bandala

318
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,266
null
it has its own ecosystem of

319
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,533
null
transformers and resolves

320
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:23,166
null
and

321
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,299
null
users have to maintain a standard long configuration

322
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,133
null
files just for just itself

323
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,166
null
and the testing environment might

324
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,333
null
end up not the same as the project

325
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,299
null
execution context

326
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,400
null
so that's not ideal

327
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,333
null
mocha is another great tool

328
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,466
null
but it is tedious

329
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,966
null
to configure mocha to make it work with other bundles

330
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,966
null
the mocha pack

331
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:54,866
null
mostly used

332
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,599
null
mocha integration with web pack

333
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,100
null
takes much time to

334
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,066
null
upgrade to web pack

335
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:08,099
null
and it still hasn't upgraded to mocha 10 yet

336
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,966
null
luckily we now have v test which is a feat based

337
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,933
null
unit testing tool so it's fast

338
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,933
null
by default and the

339
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,466
null
configurations of v test

340
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:24,333
null
is derived from the vs configuration

341
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:29,666
null
so the users runs other codes in a similar environment

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
null
and most importantly

343
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,966
null
it is well maintained

344
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:35,099
null
by people who are familiar with vit

345
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,733
所以更容易升级到新的Vit版本
so it's easier to upgrade to new vit versions

346
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:43,866
而且它也是维生素生态系统的一部分。
and it is also part of the vit ecosystem ci

347
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,266
如此多的生态系统
so much for the ecosystem

348
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:52,533
展望细节整合的未来
looking into the future of detail integration

349
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,933
我们仍有许多令人兴奋的新闻计划
we still have many exciting news things planned

350
00:18:56,866 --> 00:19:00,399
例如，这是一个常见的错误来源，即可能有多个视图副本。
for example it is a common source of bug that there

351
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,133
可能会有一个以上的视图副本
may be more than one view copies

352
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,766
在同一个笔记模块中
in the same note modules

353
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,700
所以我们想默认推导出视图包
so we want to deduce the view package by default

354
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,166
并只保留一个副本
and keep only one copy of it

355
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:17,533
我们希望在Daryl测试之后再推出这个功能。
we'd like to ship this feature after Daryl testing

356
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,933
这是另一个潜在的改进
and here's another potential improvement

357
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,466
仿佛它鼓励尽可能地使用是的模块
as though it encourages yes modules whenever possible

358
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:28,533
可能有一些遗留的包
there may be some legacy packages

359
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:32,166
是以山寨版的格式发货的
that were shipped in the cottage s format

360
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,899
而它们甚至可能需要
and they might even require the

361
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,733
视图的普通版本，所以我们要改进这种
common dress version of view so we want to improve that

362
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,399
种包
kind of package

363
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,266
是一个可中断的新包
is an interruptability with newer packages

364
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,766
而且我们想在视图插件中做一些事情
and we want to do something

365
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:53,099
在视图插件中帮助改善这种情况
in a view plugin to help improve this situation

366
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,066
我们希望在视图插件中做一些事情来帮助改善这种情况，因为它已经非常快了。
slove it is already very fast

367
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,099
总是有改进的余地
there is always room for improvement

368
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,766
而且我们不会停止寻找方法来
and we won't stop looking for ways to

369
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,366
进一步加快脚步
speed up feet even further

370
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,799
我的演讲到此结束
so that's it for my talk

371
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,866
谢谢你的聆听
thank you for listening

372
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,966
希望你喜欢用视图和壮举进行编码，谢谢
hope you enjoy coding with view and feat thanks
