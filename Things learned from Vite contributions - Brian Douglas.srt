1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,500
你们好，我的名字是布莱恩-道格拉斯
what's up y'all my name is Brian Douglas

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,366
open sauce的创始人和维护者
founder maintainer of open sauce

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,066
这将会是关于
it's gonna be talking about

4
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,766
洞察力和开放马的贡献
insights and opens horse contribution

5
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,933
所以让我继续分享我的屏幕
so let me go ahead and share my screen

6
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:13,166
并直接跳入
and jump right in

7
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:16,766
因此，去年我们有机会实际交谈
so last year we had the opportunity to actually talk

8
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,899
我们去年有机会和Avenue讨论小麦代表的2点发射问题。
to avenue about wheat rep for the 2 point launch

9
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,666
在那次谈话之后，我改变了
and after that conversation I switched

10
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,666
我们最终将所有的开放式酱料转为小麦
we ended up switching all of open sauce into wheat

11
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,733
所以非常高兴能成为这个社区的一部分
so super happy to be a part of this community

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,000
做贡献
to be contributing

13
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,699
对上游的贡献不大
not too much contributing upstream

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,133
但希望很快，因为那是我们的目标所在
but hopefully soon because that's where our goal is

15
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,399
事实上，开放源代码的贡献很好，但
actually fine open source contributions but

16
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:35,166
当我提到
when I mentioned

17
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:35,999
我很快就会去
I'm going to go quickly

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,666
给它一个快速的演示，我的现场演讲将是什么？
to give it a quick demo of what my floor talk will be

19
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,999
这将是一种像偷袭或小吃
this would be sort of like a sneak or a snack

20
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:42,933
的开放酱料的比萨饼
of open sauce that pizza

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,700
是的，我将直接跳入
and yeah I'll jump right in

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,333
是的
yeah

23
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,899
所以open sauce是开源的智能仪表板
so open sauce is open source intelligence dashboard

24
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,366
我们实际上一直在为git仓库编制索引
we're actually we've been indexing git repos

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,466
并在此基础上提供洞察力
and providing insights on top of that

26
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:53,599
所以我们一直在搞这个
so we've been messing around this

27
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,199
几乎整整一年了
for pretty much all year

28
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:56,666
我一直在全职工作
I've been working on this full time

29
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,533
在过去的三个月里
for the past 3 months

30
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,999
真的很高兴与大家分享
and really happy to share

31
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,966
我们终于有了一个网址，就是opensasa的insights。
finally we have a url which is insights at opensasa

32
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:04,933
披萨，这将是我们所有的洞察力
pizza this will be the home for all of our insights

33
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,166
和仪表盘
and dashboards

34
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,399
暂时的
for the time being

35
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
将会支持十月的节日
will be supporting October fest

36
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:12,499
通过对所有这些存储库的审查和
by vincites on all those repositories and

37
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,266
识别诸如垃圾邮件和贡献的东西
identify things like spam and contribution

38
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,466
所以一定要看一下
so definitely check it out

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,466
但我想在这里真正开始的阶段
but I wanted to really to start the stage here

40
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,866
真正的快速和谈论像github提供的东西
real quick and talk about like what github offers

41
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,933
而不是说我们想直接竞争什么
and not that what we're trying to compete directly to

42
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,366
我们希望更多的人能够贡献
get up we want more people to contribute

43
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:27,933
开源和利用github
open source and leverage github

44
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,999
但我想指出的是，github实际上有
but I do want to point out that github actually has

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,266
一些缺失的部分
some missing pieces

46
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,499
至少是这个功能的一部分
at least a part of this feature

47
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,733
所以，当你进入内部的时候，点击github
so when you go to the insides tap on github

48
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,466
这就是它的样子
this is what it looks like

49
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:36,266
这是为V
this is for v

50
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,066
而这是所有的贡献
and this is all the contribution

51
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,466
在过去的4个月里
in the last actually 4 months

52
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,966
实际上是5个月，在这一点上我的计算是错误的
actually 5 months at this point my math is off

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,566
最大的前两名贡献者是苏菲和巴托克
and the biggest top 2 contributors is Sophie and batok

54
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:49,099
和这个人指出，因为很多人不知道。
and this one on the point that out because a

55
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,700
很多人都不知道
lot of people don't know

56
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,500
你实际上可以
you could actually

57
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,466
抓取日历上的一个部分
grab just like one section of the calendar

58
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,399
然后找到那段时间的贡献
then find contributions for that time

59
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,166
很多时候，当你看到捐款时
a lot of times when you look at contributions

60
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,333
它告诉你自成立以来的无限期。
it tells you indefinitely since the inception

61
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,133
有时你只想知道谁在捐款
and sometimes you just want to know who's contributing

62
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,399
我们想用开放的酱汁来回答这个问题
recently we want to answer that question in open sauce

63
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,200
很容易回答这个问题
pretty easily

64
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,333
另一件事是像
the other thing is like

65
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:06,799
你并没有真正得到
you don't really get

66
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,533
对实际发生的事情的洞察力
insights on what actually is happening

67
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,199
你得到的是布洛姆，你看起来像分布和
you get blobs and you look like distribution and

68
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,100
活动
activity

69
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,199
正如你所看到的，安东尼在五月初有一个很大的推动力
as you see Anthony had a big push earlier in may

70
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,466
蓝V
blue v

71
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,299
有一段时间的贡献是全面的
contribution across the board for a while

72
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,266
看到这个很好
and it's good to see this

73
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,066
因为你可以看到谁在
because you can see who's

74
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,699
你可以看到谁是活跃的，如果你想联系谁
active and who to reach out to if you want to

75
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,566
在某些事情上得到解脱或解封
get unstuck or unblocked on certain things

76
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,300
但开放的酱汁，就像我们相信的那样，它
but open sauce like we believe that it

77
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,766
你不应该拥有它
you shouldn't have it

78
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,533
要知道秘密的酱汁，以便作出贡献
to know the secret sauce in order to contribute

79
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:33,933
就像我们想分享那个秘密酱汁
like we want to share that secret sauce

80
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,366
这就是我们在我们的平台上一直在做的事情
and that's what we've been doing with our platform

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,300
所以这也是同样的日历
and so this is the same calendar

82
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,133
它只是翻转
it's just flip

83
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,066
所以今天是在左边
so today's on the left

84
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,733
我们要把它转回右边
we're going to switch it back to the right

85
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,799
但无论如何，这是所有捐款的分布
but anyway this is distribution of all contribution

86
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
在过去35天里
in the last 35 days

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,700
因为很多时候
because a lot of times

88
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,800
当你想看看一个项目是否活跃时
when you want to see if a project is active

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,166
或者看看谁在社区里
or see who's around in the community

90
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,799
你想看看最近有谁在做贡献
you want to look like who's been contributing recently

91
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,600
这就是这个。
and that's what this is

92
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,000
而这些都是不良追求的代表
and these are representations of poor quest

93
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:58,299
但从一开始
but right off the bat

94
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,600
你可以看到在第一个象限，你有7天的时间
you could see in the first quadrant you have 7 days

95
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,933
是过去的7天
is the last 7 days

96
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,299
而且你已经可以看到
and already you can see

97
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,800
有一个人苏菲
there's one person Sophie

98
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,300
从其他人中脱颖而出
who's sticking out from the rest

99
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
如果它再高一点
and if it was any higher

100
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,866
我们可能会担心
we'd probably be concerned about

101
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,333
巴士因素或知识转移
bus factor or knowledge transfer

102
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,999
但这仍然是好的，低于50%的标准。
but this is it's still okay below the 50 percent Mark

103
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:14,866
但我想说的是
but what I want to

104
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,500
指出的是，实际上说这个分配
point out is that actually saying this distribution

105
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,766
现在你有一个想法，比如
now you have an idea of like

106
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,333
整个团队或跨社区发生了什么？
across a team or crossing community what's happening

107
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,000
但我们仍然处于与github相同的位置
but we're still in the same position as github

108
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,999
在那里你无法看到所有的内容
where you can't actually see all this context

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,366
除非你打开一堆标签或一堆PRS
unless you open a bunch of tabs or a bunch of prs

110
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,599
来查看什么人对什么版本有贡献
to see what kind of contributed to what release

111
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,699
所以有了open sauce，我们想让这一切变得更简单
so with open sauce we want to make this easier

112
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,300
这里有所有
here's all

113
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,733
在过去35天里发生的贡献
contributions that are happening in the last 35 days

114
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,899
或特别是Sofi
or particularly sofi

115
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,100
所以它不仅仅是一个PR
so it's not just one PR

116
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,466
它是多个PR，多个提交
it's multiple PR multiple commits

117
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,466
我们看到最上面的一个7 36
and we see like the top one 7 36

118
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,999
这就是右上角有多少行被改变了
that's how many lines have changed up in the top right

119
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,533
所以看起来像是有一些依赖关系链
so looks like there was some dependency chain

120
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,133
所以可能是软件包的锁文件
so like maybe the package lock file

121
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,866
我之前并没有研究过这个问题，但是
I didn't look into this actually prior but

122
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,000
有很多的
there's a lot of

123
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,466
依赖关系的变化
changes in dependencies

124
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,466
这就是为什么他从其他人中脱颖而出的原因
which is why he's standing out from the rest

125
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,566
但好消息是
but the good news is

126
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,733
大多数人的贡献大小都是一样的
most people have the same sort of size contributions

127
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,966
事情很容易被跟踪和审查，所以
things are easily tracked and reviewed so

128
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,533
所以很难总是审查一个大的PR
it's hard always review a large PR

129
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,999
我们能够做的另一件事是，实际上
the other thing that we were able to do is actually

130
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,000
基于索引的在线
index based online

131
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,599
嗯，所以我们可以做一些启发式的工作，确定
um so we can do some heuristics and identifying

132
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,099
是否是一个维护性的变化
whether it is a maintenance change

133
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,600
所以，如果它是一个软件包锁文件
so if it is a package lock file

134
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,566
还是说它实际上是新的代码
or if it's actually new code

135
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,733
在项目中添加的新功能
new features added to the project

136
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,066
还是只是重构
or if it's just refactoring

137
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,699
所以文件仍然是一样的
so files are still the same

138
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,099
但东西被移来移去的功能和移动
but things are moved around functions and moved around

139
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,900
所以
