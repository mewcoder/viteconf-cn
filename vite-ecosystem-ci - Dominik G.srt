1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,800
嘿嘿，我是多米尼克-G，这是
hey hey I'm Dominic g and this

2
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:08,133
是深层生态系统中心
is deep ecosystem ci

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,766
深度生态系统
the deep ecosystem

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,166
是很多的项目
is a lot of projects

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,466
许多依赖深度生态系统的软件包
many packages that depend on deep

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,299
框架，用它来构建很棒的东西
frameworks use it to build awesome things

7
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:24,299
我们今天看到了很多很酷的演讲
we've seen so many cool presentations today and

8
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,866
所有这些都是通过beat实现的
all of that is made possible by beat

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,866
它正在快速成长
it's growing fast

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,366
为了继续繁荣发展
and to continue to thrive

11
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,799
我们需要一个稳定的基础来工作
we need a stable base to work with

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,333
持续集成保证了这一点
this is ensured by continuous integration

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,966
V中的每一个变化都经过测试
every change in v is tested

14
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:46,333
在V的测试和playwright上用CI构建。
with a ci build on v tests and playwright

15
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:50,166
但它仍然发生在屏幕上
but it still happened on screen

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,933
只能运行下游的测试
it's only possible to run downstream tests

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,166
周发布之后
after week was released

18
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,166
还是说
or is it

19
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,866
使用Vitacosystem ci
with vitacosystem ci

20
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,699
我们可以在发布前运行下游测试
we are able to run downstream tests before

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,766
我们发布杂草
we release weed

22
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,999
这意味着我们可以得到
and that means we get

23
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:14,199
这意味着我们可以立即得到反馈，减少下游的失败。
immediate feedback and less fails happen downstream

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,700
为了做到这一点，我们将一个典型的维护者设置自动化了
to do that we automate a typical maintainer set up

25
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,699
链接项目
links projects

26
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,666
并安装测试，然后
and installs tests and then

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,400
报告给上游项目
reports back tothe upstream project

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
我们还支持很多工具
we also support a lot of tools that

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,300
我们也支持很多工具，这些工具是肉体生态系统的
are the meat ecosystem

30
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,566
项目使用的工具，如pmpm
project use like pmpm

31
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:37,366
纱线
yarn

32
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,166
deno

33
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,333
bit lfs
bit lfs

34
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,399
并通过自定义脚本，你可以
and through custom scripts you can

35
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,266
基本上建立一切
basically build everything

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,133
也支持嵌套
also nesting is supported

37
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,799
这对于复杂的设置是很重要的，比如
which is important for complex setups like

38
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,766
插头和膨胀以及汗水套件
plug and swelled and sweat kit

39
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,166
几乎不可能一直手动运行这个程序
almost impossible to run this manually all the time

40
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,599
所以我们使用了一个喷气式的行动
so we use a jet up action

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
矩阵来并行地运行所有的测试
matrix to run all the tests in parallel

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,966
并获得预定的反馈
and get scheduled feedback

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,466
我们可以手动触发它
we can trigger it manually

44
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,599
感谢Softy Red的杰出贡献
and thanks to an awesome contribution by softy red

45
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,699
vtpr上的评论就可以了
comment on vtpr is all it takes

46
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,799
来测试该PR中的代码
to test the code in that PR

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,466
与大多数vdecosystem ci
with most of the vdecosystem ci

48
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,133
这就是
this is

00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,533
我相信我们创造了

50
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,466
它是

51
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,299
一个很好的方法来确保
a great way to ensure the

52
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:36,599
变化做他们想做的事
changes do what they intend to

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,866
而且不会产生令人不快的副作用
and don't have unpleasant side effect

54
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:43,466
我们可以在每个节拍的提交上运行它
we can run it on every beat commit

55
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:49,599
分支标签或发布的mpm rapper street上运行。
branch tag or releases on the mpm rapper street also

56
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,933
将报告返回到discord频道
report come back to a discord channel

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,066
这样我们就有一个地方
so we have a place

58
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,866
烹饪维护者和
cooking maintainers and

59
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:02,299
谈论失败，看看需要做什么
talk about fails and see what needs to be done

60
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,666
来解决这个问题
to fix that

61
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,799
而且，当推动时，我们仍然可以在本地检查出
and when push comes to show we can still check out

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,700
生态系统CI项目
ecosystem ci project locally

63
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:13,333
使用
use

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
好的
the nice

65
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,766
设置节点来分析
set node to analyze

66
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,733
准确地找到引入故障的漫画。
the fail and find the exact comic that introduced it

67
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,366
算起来，他们已经
countly they're already

68
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,399
许多伟大的项目
many great projects

69
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,766
使用生态系统CI
using ecosystem ci

70
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,266
但要加入自己的项目也不难
but it's not hard to add your own

71
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,999
只是有一点冲突而已
it's just a little bit of conflict

72
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,666
告诉我们你的rapo和
telling us about your rapo and

73
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,733
构建和测试所需的脚本，以及
the scripts needed for building and testing and

74
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,699
其余的都是
the rest is

75
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,500
剩下的就由生态系统的CI自动完成
done automatically by ecosystem ci

76
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:53,399
这不仅有利于吃，也有利于游戏
this benefits not only eat which games

77
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,599
减少机场和石膏的反馈
less airport and plaster feedback

78
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,333
而且还有更多的覆盖面
and also a lot more coverage

79
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,066
覆盖面也比
than would be possible by

80
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,999
覆盖面要比只维护单一的测试食物多得多
maintaining just a single test food

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,133
但它也有好处
but it's also benefit

82
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,299
它也有利于使用它的项目，因为
it also benefits the projects that use it because

83
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,700
你
you

84
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,666
在Bug进入V版之前就能及早得到通知
get notified of bugs early before

85
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,466
它们进入V版并
they enter a v release and

86
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,400
可能会影响到你的用户步骤
might hit your user step

87
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,866
使用码头防御系统
use a pier defendancy

88
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:27,599
或者你对更新节拍有信心，因为
or you aim confidence for updating beat because

89
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,966
的一致性，我已经
the consistency I already

90
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,166
运行并通过你的胸部套装
ran and passed your chest suit

91
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
主要的好处之一是
one of the main benefits is that

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,466
它也允许你升级
it also allows you to upgrade

93
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:40,066
到一个新的
to a new

94
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,966
小麦的主要版本，以更快的方式
wheat major release in faster way

95
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,999
因为当一致性CI在vpita上运行并且
because when a consistency ci runs on a vpita and

96
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,699
你参与其中
you participate it in that

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,166
升级后

98
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,999
小麦已经发布了它的最终版本
wheat has released its final version

99
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:56,766
是

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,500
所以对于

维持杂草生态系统的增长
sustaining growth in the weed ecosystem

103
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:09,299
请与我们在生态系统的CI上进行合作
please collaborate on the ecosystem ci with us

104
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:14,199
并继续发挥其威力，建立一些
and continue to be awesome and build things

105
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,366
我们今天甚至没有带来的东西
