that during the velope man don bandu are told

60
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,933
我们使用现代浏览器中的模块支持
we use the module support in modern browsers

61
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,499
来启动一个深度服务器
to fire up a depth server

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,100
来传输模块
that transpires modules on the fly

63
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,566
将它们提供给浏览器
serving them to the browser

64
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,866
而且我们可以实现
and we can achieve

65
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,700
即时反馈，因为我们可以有
instant feedback because we can have

66
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,300
在模块层面上的模型替换

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,666
雪园wmr
snow park wmr

69
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:16,166
它们都是这些工具浪潮中的一部分
they are all part of these wave of tools

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,700
而且它们彼此之间有很大的影响
and they heavily influence each other

71
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,533
例如，wmr
for example wmr

72
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,866
是第一个提出通用的
the first to introduce the idea of a universal

73
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,733
像插件的API
roll up like plugin API

74
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,966
同时适用于深入的
that works with both in depth

75
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,566
和构建同时进行
and build at the same time

76
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:33,999
后来
that later on

77
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,533
采用
adopted

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
维生素
vit

79
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,599
是我们共同系统中其他工具的一个指示
is an instruction of our other tools in the co system

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,966
在比尔时代
during Bill time

81
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:47,466
你可以把它看成是一个有意见的
you can think about it as an opinionated

82
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:48,799
为卷起的设置
setup for roll up

83
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:54,066
我们尽可能地使用es Bill来加快处理速度
we use es Bill wherever we can to speed up processing

84
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:58,699
例如，对CSS和shas进行最小化，或者剥离
for example minification of CSS and shas or stripping

85
00:03:58,866 --> 00:03:59,666
类型
types

86
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,533
我们采取一种务实的方法
and we take a pragmatic approach

87
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,399
我们不需要barbell
we don't need barbell

88
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,599
在所有情况下，但
in all cases but

89
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:09,799
但对于支持所有浏览器的传统插件来说
for plugging legacy to support all the browsers

90
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
我们会向它伸出援手
we'll reach out to it

91
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,733
我们也使用os CSS
we also use os CSS

92
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:17,166
在内部处理CSS
process CSS internally

93
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,666
也是为了更好地与CSS标准接轨
and also to better align with CSS standards

94
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,266
使用Ved时
when using ved

95
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,533
保护自己免受生态系统变化的影响
are guarding yourself against changes in the ecosystem

96
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:33,733
例如，我们可以在未来将valvel改为sdc
for example we could change valvel to sdc in the future

97
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,400
和包裹团队
and the parcel team

98
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,366
的汽车现在发布它

99
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,766
照明CSS
lighting CSS

100
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:44,299
这是一个Ross流程的替代方案，而不是占有CSS
that is a Ross process alternative to poss CSS

101
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,400
我们也可以采用它来加快CSS的处理速度
we could also adopt it to speed up CSS processing

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,366
现在，我们对ES的建设非常满意
and right now we are very happy with es build

103
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,900
但是，如果一致走向swc
butif the consistent move towards swc

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,700
我们可能最终也会取代它作为内部建设
we may end up also replacing it as building internally

105
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,133
和
and

106
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:05,099
所有这些
all of these

107
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,933
都可以在不影响用户的情况下完成
can be done with little disruption or users

108
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:09,966
而且
and

109
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,466
我不知道这是否会是
I don't know if this is going to be

110
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,800
我们在未来会使用的
those we will use in the future

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,933
但你要么
but you either

112
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:18,499
因此，小麦中的那个东西实际上
so that thing in wheat actually

113
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:21,299
再一次帮助你防范这些变化
again help you guard again these changes

114
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:26,699
小麦对视图有很大的支持

115
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,300

118
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,133
实际上

119
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,733
这些框架的团队
teams from these frameworks

120
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,266
都参与了小麦团的开发。
are involved in the development of wheat corps

121
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,299
而且我们有非常好的
and we have really good

122
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,800
所有这些的健康模型替换
health model replacement for all of them

123
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,600
这使得像 astro 这样的工具
this allows tools like astro

124
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,200
等工具可以建立在小麦的基础上，并专注于新的功能
to build on top of wheat and focus on new features

125
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,300
或
or

126
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,466
探索新的架构，如小岛的架构
explore new architecture like island's architecture

127
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,533
Astra不需要重新雇用
Astra doesn't need to re employment

128
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,066
一切
everything

129
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,933
的框架和维护者已经在小麦中完成的工作。
that is already done in wheat by the frameworks and

130
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:12,533
小麦公司的维护者
the maintainers of wheat corp

131
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:16,199
故事书的目标是一样的
the same goal for a storybook

132
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:17,766
那
that

133
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,500
想象一下，如果一个故事书必须要重新创建
actually imagine if a storybook will have to recreate

134
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,699
所有这些
everything that

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,933
这些框架所做的一切
have been done by these frameworks

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,966
我们可以在一个较低的水平上分享
and we get to share at a lower level

137
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,800
因为卷轴式贝斯插件的API非常灵活
because the roll up bass plug in API is very flexible

138
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,199
因此，我们可以有比如说
so we can have for example

139
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,099
与plagium PW a
with plagium PW a

140
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:45,499
来抽象出我们框架中对PW a的支持

141
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,466
或者

154
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,333
他们创建了一套库
they created a set of libraries

155
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,699
在这个过程中，他们创建了一套库，在安凯的保护伞下
under the anchaeus umbrella

156
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:32,699
其他人后来也可以用它来实现同样的目的

他们正在与反应团队合作，以确保
and they are working with the react team to ensure

163
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,299
他们正在与反应团队合作，以确保反应组件在Vit上正常工作。

和
and

166
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,800
因为velkit是相当重要的，因为ssr
as velkit is quite important because the ssr

167
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:00,999
基元，我们现在都在享受这些基元

175
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,566
基于view和wheat
based on view and wheat

176
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,733
的静态尺寸发生器，我们在生态系统的很多文件中使用
that we use in a lot of documentations

177
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,899
生态系统中

快速团队的快速城市
quick city from the quick team

179
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:28,399
一个类似的东西，它是一个Angular amp的小麦

186
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,700
大量的用户将
a lot of users are going

187
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,000
通过一个框架来体验维生素
to experience vit through a framework

188
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:49,766
事实上，大多数人都是如此
most of them actually

189
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,066
但所有这些框架
but all these frameworks

190
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,000
一起合作
get to collaborate together

191
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,766
来改善衬衫工具
into improving the shirt tool

192
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,099
因此，这是一个非0变焦的游戏
so this is a non 0 zoom game

193
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,300
每个人都能得到一个更好的工具

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,300
为他们的组件测试的新功能
for their new features of component testing

198
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:27,533
在测试方面，它是一个原生的、替代胸部的工具。
on the test is a native with alternative to chest

199
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,166
它实际上是为自己的生态系统服务的。
and it actually does serve an ecosystem talk of its own

200
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,366
它已经看到了大量的采用
it's seen a huge amount of adoption

201
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,666
它已经被大量采用，并可能成为推动脚踏实地的主要动力之一。
and is going to be probably one of the main

202
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,199
它已被大量采用，并可能成为推动脚步前进的主要动力之一。
drivers of adoption of feet moving forward

203
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,166
你也可以用它来测试节点
you can use it also to test node

204
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,933
例如，Remix
and for example the remix

205
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,999
正在使用wheatas和他们的启动器
are using wheatas and their starters

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,566
但他们并没有使用小麦
but they are not using wheat

207
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,166
和
and

208
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,066
测试可以享受到

209
00:09:55,666 --> 00:10:00,566
快速的热模型替换，用于你的单元测试
fast hot model replacement on feed for your unit tests

210
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,133
所以你可以得到这种即时反馈
so you get this instant feedback

211
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
我们现在在开发时就有这样的反馈
that we have while developing now

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,133
当你检查你的测试时
while you check your tests

213
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:10,533
和
and

214
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:14,933
我们正处于一个新的Shayes环境时代的到来。
we are in the down of a new era of shayes environments

215
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,066
没有Shayes不再是孤独的了
no shayes is no longer alone

216
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:21,133
你有其他的环境，比如他们知道
you have other environments like they know

217
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:22,699
或禁止
or a ban

218
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,133
和
and

219
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,500
网络容器从一个小堆栈，导致你运行
webcontainers from a stacklet that led you ran

220
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,799
在浏览器中没有shayes
no shayes in the browser

221
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
四叶草工人和其他边缘网络
Clover workers and other edge networks

222
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:35,999
和
and

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,533
所有这些环境都非常关心
all of this environment care a lot

224
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,700
关于适当的维生素支持
about proper vit support

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,066
因为它的影响力
because of the reach

226
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:44,199
我们之前看到的一个框架系统
a system of framework that we saw before

227
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,733
如果他们得到了vitworking的支持
if they get vitworking on them

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,533
他们就会有很多的用户
they are going to get a lot of users

229
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:52,766
所以有很多的合作
so there is a lot of collaboration

230
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,699
所以在小麦和这些
between wheat and these

231
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,300
环境和这些团队之间的合作
environments and these teams

232
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,999
我们还需要部署我们的应用程序
we also need to deploy our applications

233
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,366
为此，我们需要服务有
and for that we need the services to have

234
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:10,899
对我们所建工具的开箱即用的支持
out of the box support for our built tools

235
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,800
我们已经看到了这一点。
and we are seeing this already with vit

236
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,999
netly 5 versail
netly 5 versail

237
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Clover workers firebase
Clover workers firebase

238
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,533
可能会简化它，然后是其他一个
probably simplify it then one others

239
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,733
我们非常关心为小麦提供一个好的
care a lot about giving a good

240
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,399
小麦的用户故事
user story for wheat

241
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,500
例如，nellify已经创建了一个插件。
for example nellify has created a plugin with plug in

242
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,366
所以框架可以
so frameworks can

243
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,333
以更简单的方式使用他们的边缘网络
use their edge network in an easier way

244
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:44,799
小麦也被视为大量采用
wheat is also seen a lot of adoption

245
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,266
伞状框架上
on the umbakand frameworks

246
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,333
小麦的先锋Ruvi
pioneer by wheat ruvi

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,066
显示，你可以使用vid来获得
thatshow that you can use vid to get

248
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:57,499
即时反馈，同时开发骑行请求
instant feedback while developing ride supplications

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,733
这为laravel的发展铺平了道路
this pave the way for laravel

250
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,400
现在采用vid作为他们的默认版本
now adopted vid as their default

251
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,766
这对Vita来说是一个巨大的选择
this is huge for vita option

252
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:14,533
让我们来关注一下其中的一个子生态系统
let's focus on one of the sub ecosystems

253
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,366
故事的生态系统
the story's ecosystem

254
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,800
在这里，我们必须要对故事书给予很大的肯定
we have to give a lot of credit to a storybook here

255
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,933
因为他们为故事创造了一个开放的标准
because they created an open standard for stories that

256
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
它正在受益于
it's benefiting

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
像这个生态系统
like this ecosystem

258
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,800
小麦降低了创建一个新故事的门槛，就像
wheat lower the barrier for creating a new story like

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,866
一个故事书，如弗兰克的作品
a storybook like frank work

260
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:40,366
所以我们看到了像《维塔沃克的故事》这样的弗兰克作品。
so we are seeing franks like is histoire vitwook laddle

261
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:41,366
和
and

262
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,933
他们都可以尝试新的想法
they all get to try new ideas

263
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,733
我们还看到
we are also seeing

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,733
previewshayes和volar是vs代码的扩展。
previewshayes and volar that are vs code extensions

265
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,666
但他们在内部使用小麦
but they use wheat internally

266
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,866
来实时预览你所开发的组件
to preview components in real time what you develop

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,100
有点像线上故事
kind of like in line stories

268
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:01,366
和
and

269
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,366
也是为什么框架
also why frame

270
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,566
这给了
that gives

271
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,100
原始的村民自己的故事书
primitive to vill your own storybook

272
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,366
和
and

273
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:12,166
这对故事书本身有很大的好处
this has a lot of benefits for a storybook itself

274
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,800
因为一个故事书可以看到它
because a storybook gets to see it

275
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,999
别人在做什么，什么是不可行的，而且
what others are doing and what works are not and

276
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,800
他们以后可以采用你
they can later adopt you

277
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,166
故事书现在也在大量使用视频。
storybook is also using vid a lot now

278
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,966
Anvit也有违反其他社区的情况
anvit also has breaches to other communities that

279
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,599
不是直接下游的
are not directly downstream

280
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,933
下游或上游项目
downstream or upstream projects

281
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:40,766
例如，bmpm有大量的使用。
for example there is a lot of usage of bmpm

282
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,099
和相关项目的使用。
on with related projects

283
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:44,166
和
and

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,466
在bmpm的价值方面有很多的一致性
there is a lot of alignment in the values of bmpm

285
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,966
比如说pmpm是一个非常
like is a pmpm is a very

286
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,299
是一个非常快速和有效的公园灰烬管理器
fast and efficient park ash manager

287
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,100
还有

288
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,500
故事是
story is

289
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,099
它可以让你创建
that lets you create

290
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,666
停止应用程序
the stop applications

291
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,333
形成不同的模具，高效安全
that are various mold and efficient and secure

292
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,933
他们内部也在使用小麦
they are also using wheat internally

293
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,333
所以与他们合作是有意义的
so it makes sense to collaborate with them

294
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:17,133
为游乐场的功能提供了雏形
staglets for the playground feature

295
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:20,333
他们需要他们的应用程序立即启动
they need their applications to start right away

296
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,866
而v深度服务器的按需使用特性
and the on demand nature

297
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,733
v深度服务器对这种使用情况来说是非常好的。
of the v depth server is amazing for that use case

298
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,299
因为你可以在
because you get in

299
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:29,899
在一瞬间
in a split second

300
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:31,799
一个游乐场工作
a playground working

301
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:35,999
所以我们已经看到很多人采用了 "契约"。
so we have seen a lot of adoption of deed

302
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,666
例如，在文件中尝试
for example in documenttemptation

303
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,666
游乐场和例子

308
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,699
坑是一个

309
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,533
巨大的工具和框架的生态系统的一部分。
huge ecosystem of tools and frameworks and plaguines

310
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,666
所有这些项目一起工作
and all these projects work together

311
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,500
协作并分享想法和模式
to collaborate and share ideas and patterns

312
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:13,399
我们实际上还没有触及到这个生态系统的表面
we actually didn't scratch the surface of

313
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,566
这个生态系统的范围有多大
how reach all this ecosystem is

314
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,000
而且
and

315
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:22,599
这又是关于人与人之间的合作
again this is about people people working together

316
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,000
互相帮助
helping each other

317
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:28,166
而这是很难复制的
and this is really difficult to replicate

318
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
一个生态系统
an ecosystem

319
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,100
是一个开源项目的最佳资产之一
is one of the best assets of an open source project

320
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,166
所以

同样
