1
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:14,766
我不打算从
I'm not to start with

2
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:17,766
说说我是如何在OK源中做出贡献的故事
a story of how I got into contributing in ok source

3
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,466
所以在2020年的时候
so back in 2020

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,966
我得到了我的第一个Futangian PSA front m wbp opera
I got my first futangian PSA front m wbp opera

5
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,599
但当时我有一个问题
but at the time I have an issue

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
在那里我试图找到
where I'm trying to find

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,733
技术来学习
technologies to learn

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,933
但我总是
but I always

9
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,733
没有时间把它放在副业上
don't have the time to put it in the side projects

10
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:32,866
所以我在想
so I was thinking

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,933
什么东西可以更省力
what could be less effort

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,733
但又能得到同样的游戏回报
but have thissame game in return

13
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:41,099
因此，当我走进开放源码项目的时候
so that's when I walk into open source projects and

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,400
我贡献的第一个项目是V Pluginso Belt
the first one I contribute to is v pluginso belt

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,366
它是一个
which is a

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,533
的插件。
plugin from v

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,200
和
and

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,400
我很喜欢它，我在世界和一个表格中使用它。
I quite like it I use it at world and a form

19
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,666
但后来我做了一个修正
but then I made a fix

20
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,466
然后
and then

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,166
我发现的是，fick
what I find is that fick

22
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,899
我可以为每个使用该软件包的人做出贡献
I may contribute to everyone who's using the package

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,666
和
and

24
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,699
我觉得有一种
I kind of feel a

25
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,533
很好的了解了这一点
great knowing about that

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,400
从那以后，我就一直在做开源的工作。
and from there on I've been working on open sources so

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,166
今天的主题可以是贡献一个或一个
the topic for today can be contributing one or one

28
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:12,366
其中
which

29
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:12,733
我已经有了
I've got

30
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,699
味道和技巧以及你需要知道的一切
taste and tricks and everything you need to know

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,333
关于在开源世界中的贡献
about contributing in the world of open source

32
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:22,566
关于我，我是来自马来西亚的Brdu。
so a little bit about me I'm brdu and from Malaysia

33
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,499
我目前是feed和sabel的核心团队成员。
I am currently a core team member on feed and sabel

34
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:28,599
我也是Astro的一个核心成员。
I'm also a core resident in astro

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,133
我一直在与
I've been doubling with

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,400
我已经和open swords合作了2年了
open swords for about 2 years right now

37
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:33,266
而且
and

38
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,566
我也学会了自然，可以花几个小时
I also learned nature could spend like hours

39
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,099
观察天空什么的
watching sky or something

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,766
但没有进一步的废话
but without further ado

41
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:42,666
跳到
jump next to

42
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,533
主要观点
the main point

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,100
这就是开放源码
which is open source

44
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:48,199
所以你可能会注意到任何一个开放源码社区
so you may notice any open source community

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,166
我们都有这个缩写，叫做OSS
we have this acronym called oss

46
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,699
那么什么是OSS呢？
so what is oss

47
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,533
OSS是开放源码软件的缩写
oss stands for open source software

48
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,666
就是你可以直接阅读的软件
which is software that you can read

49
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,266
直接阅读源代码
the source code directly

50
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,899
来了解它是如何工作的
to understand how it works

51
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:02,899
而且很多时候
and often times

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,133
时，该软件还与一种叫做
when the software is also related to something called

53
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:10,066
foss，也就是免费的f星。
foss which is f that stars for free

54
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,899
所以自由和开放的软件
so free and open software

55
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,366
它说你读了一个kps
it says you read a kps

56
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,499
开放源码总是容易传播
open source always easily distributed

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,200
免费的
free

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,733
但有时你也可以看到付费软件
but sometimes you can see paid software as well

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,300
比如说
for example

60
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,366
付费许可证或商业许可证
paid licenses or commercial licenses

61
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,699
但你可以清楚地注意到一个问题
but you could clear notice a problem

62
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,966
如果它是免费的，或者说它是自己维持的
if it's free or does it sustain itself

63
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,799
所以这是个大问题
so this is a big deal

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
有时你会注意到像
and sometimes you notice like

65
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,333
一个问题，得到在起床
an issue that gets on get up

66
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,066
有人问是否需要维护项目
where someone's asking if projects to maintain

67
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:39,999
有时这是真的
sometimes it's true

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,466
因为该项目工作得很好，就像这样
because the project is working fine as this

69
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:43,399
而且没有
and there isn't

70
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,266
任何需要维护的东西
anything that needs to be maintained

71
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,166
因此，它是完全正确的
so that it's perfectly fine

72
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,966
但有时它实际上是被放弃了
but sometimes it actually is abandoned

73
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,800
因为项目的维护者
because the project maintainers

74
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,500
没有足够的资源来继续进行这个项目
doesn't have the resources to continue on the project

75
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:55,899
而被遗弃，就像这样
and is left as this

76
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,366
这也是一个问题
and this is also an issue

77
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,500
这也是一个在开源领域经常出现的问题。
that comes up often in the or of open source

78
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:05,199
因此，我们如何帮助，所以从
so how do we help so from

79
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,699
我目前的经验是
my experience touch far is that

80
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,400
从我的经验来看，我们可以帮助的事情基本上是有的。
there is basically treat things that we could help

81
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,699
所以可以这样说
so the way to

82
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,133
总结一下，就是
summarize it is that

83
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:14,966
与代码
with code

84
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:16,999
社区和资金
community and funding

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,166
所以在这个演讲中，我想深入探讨这3点
so in this talk I like to deep dive into these

86
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,499
3点，并提供信息，说明你如何能够
3 points and provide information on how you could

87
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,600
在这些领域工作并为之做出贡献
work in this areas and contribute to them

88
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,266
因此，贡献代码
so contributing code

89
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:31,133
在他们的项目中，我们做的第一件事将是
the first thing we do in their project will be

90
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,333
制作报告
making about reports

91
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,933
所以，如果你发现了一个问题，你就会创建有关报告
so if you find an issue you create about report

92
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,166
但需要注意的是
but something important to notice is that

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,866
确保这实际上是
making sure that is actually

94
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:39,766
以上
above

95
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,066
有时你可能只有一个问题
sometimes you may only have a question

96
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,200
或者你不确定你是否在做这件事
or you're uncertain if you're doing it

97
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,333
正确的方式
the right way

98
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:49,066
有时它实际上是一个配置问题，即
sometimes it is actually a configuration issue where

99
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,533
在你的项目中你没有
in your project you are not

100
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,366
正确使用该项目
using the project correctly

101
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,600
所以
so

102
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,933
知道它是否在上面，可以节省大量的时间
knowing if it's above or not saves a lot of time

103
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,333
而且在这一点上
and in that

104
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,933
在这一点上，你也要遵循模板，所以每个
point you will also want follow the template so each

105
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,199
储存库可能会或可能不会尝试
repositories may or may not have attempted

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,766
时都会尝试。
when falling an issue

107
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,966
如果他们这样做，对所有的问题都很重要
if they do its important for all the issues

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,700
和
and

109
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,400
达到通过他们和下降的指示，以
reach through them and fall instructions to

110
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,100
的结果
the result

111
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,000
将创造一个最小的复制
will create a minimum reproduction

112
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,566
但有时对维护者来说，重要的是
but sometimes it is important for maintainers to

113
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,533
容易重现的问题，这样他们就可以很容易地解决它。
easily reproduce issues so that they can easily hit it

114
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,499
迅速做出修复，而不是
make fix quickly instead of

115
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,766
让每个人
having everyone

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,066
手动实现你自己的中心
manually implementing your own center

117
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,700
因此，这是功能和代码
so this is functional and code

118
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,800
但是，从这里得到的主要收获是
but the main takeaway from this is that

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,900
它为贡献者节省了时间
it save times for contributors

120
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
不仅仅是维护者，还有
not only to maintainers but

121
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,766
任何有兴趣帮助这个项目的人
anyone who is interested in helping in the project

122
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,333
也将受益于
will also benefit from

123
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:43,766
如果你遵循
if you follow

124
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,766
这些指南
these guides

125
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,600
但这些网站正在创建酒吧报告
but the sites are creating bar reports

126
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,533
还有一些你可以做的事情，那就是
there's something else you can do which is

127
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,566
直接进行自我修复
directly making to fix yourself

128
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,266
因此，当你开始进行修复时
so when you start making a fix

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
它可能是
it could be

130
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:59,133
在一个小项目中，或者在一个大项目中
on a small project or can be in a big project

131
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,666
或小项目，你可能需要
or small project you may take

132
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,166
30分钟或一个多小时
30 minutes or an hour plus

133
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:04,899
来
to

134
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,766
消化所有东西并进行修复
digest everything and make the fix

135
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,500
但有时在一个大项目中，这可能是困难的
but sometimes in a big project it could be hard

136
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,000
这也是可以理解的
which is understandable

137
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,000
时至今日，我还没有真正
to this day I don't really

138
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,333
我不太了解警察的一切
understand everything in a v cop base

139
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,600
但这并不重要
but that is fine

140
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,666
开始的简单方法是阅读
and an easy way to start off is to read

141
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,766
贡献指南
the contributing guide

142
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:21,666
你应该有
you should have

143
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,299
所有你需要的信息
all the information you need

144
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,000
在本地设置该项目
to set up the project locally

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,866
测试它和
to test it and

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,200
来进行你所遇到的修改，以及在哪里可以找到它。
to make changes that you meet and where to find it and

147
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,799
我还发现从修复about开始是最容易的。
I've also found it easiest to start with fixing about

148
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,966
因为about通常触及一个非常具体的领域
since about usually touches a very specific domain

149
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,600
所以你只需要修复
so you only have to fix

150
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,700
也许是一个特定的文件，也许只是一个目录
maybe a specific file or maybe just a directory

151
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,699
所以你不需要阅读整个
so you don't have to read the entire

152
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,466
拷贝来进行自己的修复
copies to make your own fix

153
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:51,133
而仅仅是某一小段代码
but onlya certain small piece of code

154
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,766
通常这就足以让你获得
and usually this is enough for you to gain

155
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:57,099
获得关于该因素的上下文软
gain context on the factor soft

156
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:00,066
并发送一个PR或完整的请求
and send a PR or full request

157
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:02,133
但有时，如果你不能遵循
but sometimes if you can't follow

158
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:02,866
事实上
indeed

159
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,366
我们在这个法庭上有一个贡献渠道，其中
we have a contributing channel in this court where

160
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,699
所有的贡献者
all the contributors

161
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,166
包括核心维护者都在那里提供帮助
including the core maintainers are there to help

162
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:10,166
和
and

163
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,166
但同样重要的是要理解，有时
but it's also important to understand that sometimes

164
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,399
人们很忙，而且
people are busy and

165
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,333
他们可能不会很快完全得到一些
they may not get entirely few soon

166
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,733
所以你可能要自己去摸索
soyou may have to feel things on yourself

167
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:20,599
但我认为
but I think

168
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,500
最终这导致了最后的一点，即
ultimately this leads to the final point where

169
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:24,133
这
this

170
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,299
一个自我学习的经验，其中
a self learning experience where

171
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,933
你在这个世界上更加独立。
you're more independent on your own in the world

172
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:30,866
开放源代码
open source

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,900
但你也会在一天结束时
but you also at the end of day

174
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,066
为维护者节省时间，因为
save time for maintainers since

175
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,699
因为从长远来看，你是在帮他们的忙。
you're doing them a favor in the long run

176
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,899
你可以做的另一件事是
another thing you could do is

177
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,533
通过对报告征收三倍的费用
by triharging about reports

178
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,933
所以在右边的图片上
so on the image on the right

179
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,333
你可以看到，有一堆的问题
you could see that there is a bunch of issues

180
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,133
哪些是没有
which is not

181
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,199
还没有被查看
being viewed yet

182
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,333
而这是一个
and this is a

183
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:54,566
开源项目的常见问题是
common problem in being open source projects is that

184
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,499
有这么多的问题，但却没有那么多的
there are so many problems but there's so little

185
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,133
时间去了解
time to understand

186
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,933
这究竟是一个问题
is that actually a problem

187
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,933
还是它已经被固定为一个陷阱
or it's already fixed as a trap

188
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,533
这有点像回到了第一点，即
which kind of brings back to point number one where

189
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,366
你应该
you should

190
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,499
了解它在哪里
understand where it's above

191
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,366
或不
or not

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
但如果你对树的问题感兴趣的话
but if you're interested in tree are doing issues

193
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,933
这是一个非常有帮助的事情
which is a very helpful thing to do

194
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,099
因为他们作为防御的第一个迹象
because they act as the first signs of defense

195
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,666
在
before

196
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,666
问题到达维护者手中之前的第一道防线
the issue reached to the hands on the maintainers

197
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,266
因为有时一个问题是
because sometimes an issue is

198
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,200
无效的
invalid

199
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,333
或选择或复制
or elects or reproduction

200
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:27,099
在我们深入研究之前，这些问题可能很容易被撇开。
these could be easy to skim off before we dive deeper

201
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,900
到它
into it

202
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,800
而且
and

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,066
通过所有这些问题也有助于
going through all these issues also helps

204
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,366
了解教育工作者
understand educators

205
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:35,699
有时你会发现一个非常具体的问题
sometimes you find a very specific issue

206
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,366
或5个或更多的问题
or 5 or more issues

207
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,133
彼此之间有某种联系
that are kind of related to each other

208
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:42,966
这样你就有了关于具体问题的背景
so you have like context on specific issues

209
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,166
在那里你可以解决
where you can fix

210
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,666
而不是只解决一个非常具体的问题。
in a holistic way instead of fixing just

211
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,566
一个非常具体的事情
one very specific thing

212
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,366
还有
and also

213
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,366
对问题进行分类有助于你
triagging issues helps you

214
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,866
了解决策背后的背景
understand the context behind decisions

215
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,299
例如，如果维护者决定
for example if maintainers decide to

216
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,266
拒绝一项提议
reject a proposal

217
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,266
或拒绝
or reject

218
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,566
也许是因为它是故意的
about maybe because it's intentional

219
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:03,933
或者说这是个很好的理由
or maybe that's like a very good reason

220
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,466
它是出于对其产品的嘲弄
it is out of scoop of its product

221
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
所以知道如何添加
so knowing how to add

222
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,733
在某些情况下，这样做是非常有帮助的
in certain cases like this is very helpful

223
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,199
因为你可以想
because you could think

224
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,266
维护者的思维方式，这
the way maintainers think and that

225
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,666
有助于释放一些
helps to release some

226
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,566
他们所承担的责任
responsibilities that they have

227
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,199
当然
and of course

228
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,299
这个选项需要在项目中体验
this option needs to experience in a project

229
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,000
方向和他们在整个项目中的理念。
direction and their philosophy in the whole

230
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,533
和另一件事来做和
and another thing to do and

231
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,333
对代码的贡献是审查代码的变化
contributing to code is reviewing code changes

232
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,766
所以基本上当
so basically when

233
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,499
在项目中，你可能有完整的请求
in the project you might have full request

234
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,266
与一堆的变化
with a bunch of changes

235
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,266
审查代码需要时间
reviewing tr takes time stupiers

236
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,533
你需要确保
you need to make sure that

237
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,733
什么变化是正确的
what change is correct

238
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:42,799
而且它不会
and it doesn't

239
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:44,199
破坏其他东西
break anything else

240
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,133
所以如果你是审查PRS的新手
so if you're new to reviewing prs

241
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,066
从小事做起是个好地方
starting small is a good place to start

242
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
或例子
or example

243
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,899
微观变化文件
micro changes documentation

244
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,300
或
or

245
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
小的修复，谁
small fixes who

246
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,166
是非常具体的
are very specific

247
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,266
较大的外套，容易消化
larger in the coat which is easily digestible

248
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:00,333
但也
but also

249
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,866
提出意见也会给你带来很大的帮助
making comments also brings you to a long way

250
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:06,166
只是对你可能发现的具体问题进行评论
just making comments on specific issues you may find

251
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:10,199
例如，尝试在当地测试PRS，你会发现
for example try to test prs locally and you find

252
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,700
问题，也可能没有
problems or maybe not

253
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,899
但这表明你把
but this shows that you put

254
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,933
努力去审查PRS
effort into reviewing prs

255
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,666
所以发表评论会让它对维护者来说更可信。
so making comments kind of makes it more credible to

256
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,900
维护者
the maintainers

257
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,800
知道你确实付出了努力
knowing that you actually put effort into it

258
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,900
除非
unless

259
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,333
这也是上一点的内容，即
this also counts up to the previous point which is

260
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,600
学习接触
learning the contact

261
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,766
决策者背后的联系，而维护者可能
behind the decisions that maintainers may

262
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:33,099
有时你会遇到维护者拒绝修改的情况
sometimes you have changes that maintainers reject

263
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,366
或者是他们要求
or maybe they request

264
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,999
对其进行特定的焦化修改
specific coke changes to it

265
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,533
这可以帮助你了解你的项目所使用的特定模式
this helps you understand specific patterns that

266
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,799
你的项目使用的具体模式
your project uses

267
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,100
再往前走，你就开始
further along you start

268
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,666
了解你应该遵循的具体模式
understanding specific patterns that you should follow

269
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,066
而且你可以对它进行Venus处理
and you can Venus along to it

270
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:50,366
当你开始审查PRS时也是如此
and when you start reviewing prs as well

271
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,199
并最终
and ultimately

272
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,266
从以前的观点来看
from the previous points

273
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,799
你实际上是在应用你的经验
you are actually applying your experience

274
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,599
查看你的PRS时
when view your prs

275
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,933
因此，从分流问题到制造问题或
so from triaging issues making issues or

276
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,099
只是做一个修复
just making a fix

277
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,866
这些都有助于最终审查PRS
these are all helpful in ultimately reviewing the prs

278
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,766
编写的代码，这些代码将进入
that is code that's going into

279
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
主项目的代码
the main project

280
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,333
所以要总结一下
so to kind of summarize the

281
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,599
贡献的观点
contribution point of view

282
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,533
你可以看到，在很长一段时间内
you can kind of see that for a long

283
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,366
责任开始上升
responsibility start to rise

284
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:23,099
所以
so

285
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,466
这或多或少像是一个光谱，当你成为
this is more or less like a spectrum when you become

286
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,199
贡献者到指导者
a contributor to a mentator

287
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,466
所以你的责任越大，你就越
so the more responsible you can get the more

288
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,366
你就越重要
important you are

289
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,333
但在下一个问题上，我们有一个社区
but on the next point we have the community

290
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,333
所以
so

291
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,999
社区也是另一个非常
community is also another very

292
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,866
在一个项目中非常重要的方面
important aspect in a project

293
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,266
如果没有社区的存在
without a community there

294
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,099
该项目基本上是
the project is basically

295
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:47,566
没有人使用它
no one uses it

296
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:48,699
所以
so

297
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,933
第一件重要的事情是提出正确的问题
the first important thing is asking the right questions

298
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,800
所以当你
so when you

299
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,066
时，你不会真的只是
go in and comedy you don't really just

300
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,733
去github或者随便去哪里
go on github or just go anywhere

301
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,133
重要的是要知道在哪里，因为
it is important to know where as that

302
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,066
你应该提出问题
you are supposed to ask questions

303
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,133
以及你应该提供的信息
and also the information that you should give

304
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,133
有时
sometimes

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
你给它太长了
you give it too long

306
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,266
太过口头化
it's too verbals

307
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,999
人们并不真的喜欢
people don't really feel like

308
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,100
检查它，因为
checking it because

309
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,400
因为这就像一篇文章，我花了很多精力去了解一个问题
it's like an essay and I've put a lot of effort to

310
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,166
了解一个问题
understand a question

311
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,100
但要尽量短小精悍，以提供
but try to be short andconcise got to give

312
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,666
所有需要的信息
all the information needed

313
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,333
以便有人能读一遍
so that someone can read it once

314
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,933
他们就可以回答一次
and they can answer it once

315
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,399
这样就能节省双方的时间
so it saves time in both parties

316
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,500
保持一个简短的房子，以
of keeping a short house done to

317
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,566
减少连接性的流程
reduce a connective flow

318
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,366
当他们试图了解你的问题是什么
when they try to understand what your problem is

319
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,966
还有
and also

320
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,466
信号尽量不要在
signal try not to spam in

321
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,066
渠道
the channels

322
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,099
有时
and sometimes

323
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,066
不是每个人都有时间来
not everyone has a time to

324
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:45,299
检查你的问题或你的问题
check out your problem or your question

325
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,500
这很重要
it's important

326
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,733
请随时支付
feel free to always pay

327
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,799
再来一次，比如在几个小时后，这样
again like in a couple of hours so that

328
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
每个人都有机会
everyone has a chance to

329
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,899
在时机成熟的时候再重新审视这个问题
revisit that again when the time comes

330
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,799
在你提出问题的时候
and while you're asking out questions

331
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,733
和有用的提示
and helpful tip

332
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,333
那么我有
then I had

333
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,966
在过去，尽量在同一时间回答他们的问题
in the past as try to answer them at the same time

334
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:00,566
所以
so

335
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,366
在你问问题之前，你可以
before you ask questions you can

336
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,933
看看是否有其他人有问题
thearound see if anyone else have problems

337
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,499
你可以试着回答他们
you can try to answer them

338
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:07,699
如果你能做到最好
the best if you can

339
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,300
并提供想法，即使你不确定如何解决它
and give ideas even if you're not sure how to fix it

340
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,566
这也是一个很好的方法，可以
and that is a great way to

341
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,866
邀请别人来回答你的问题
invite others to answer your question as well

342
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,399
这就像一个双向的街头服饰
this is like a 2 way streetwear

343
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:20,999
每个人都在互相帮助
everyone is helping each other

344
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:22,933
和其他任何一天
and any other day

345
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,200
一些问题实际上是一个问题的房间，其中
something questions actually room to a problem where

346
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,266
文件是一个问题
documentation is a problem

347
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,766
需要澄清的问题
needs to be clarified

348
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,100
和所有这些导致
and all these leads to

349
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
了解痛点或项目
understanding the pain points or the project

350
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,900
因此，这是一个非常重要的事情，其中
so this is a very important thing where

351
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,866
用户自己的项目不比维护者多
the users auto project no more than the maintainers

352
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,399
因此，对于打
so for beat

353
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,200
这里有一些链接，击败用户或支持
here are like a few links that beat users or support

354
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,933
你可以打电话给聊天VHS com死亡，这是
you can call chat VHS com death which is

355
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,899
一个链接，我们可以看到迪斯科的帮助
a link to discord we can see for help

356
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,699
或者我们也可以询问和
or we can also ask and

357
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,000
可以在VHS中讨论，在我们的repo中讨论。
can have discussion in theVHS in our repo

358
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
你也可以查看VHS在开发中的文档
you can also check out the documentation at VHS on dev

359
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,400
和
and

360
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,466
文档
the documentation

361
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:05,133
也可以在VHS repo中进行修改。
changes could also be made on the VHS repo

362
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,399
因此，下一个问题将是资金
and so the next one will be funding

363
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,066
所以资金也是另一个重要方面
so funding is also another important aspect

364
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,733
即使你只是为它提供资金
even if you're only contributing money to it

365
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:13,766
是
is

366
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:16,399
对任何项目来说，要维持你的主题，就必须要有战斗力
fighter for any project to sustain your subject

367
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,100
春天的层级总是花自己的空闲时间
spring tiers are always spending their own free time

368
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,066
工作，所以
working on it so

369
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,333
一种方法是使用赞助
one way is to use sponsorship

370
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:26,599
以每月或一次性的方式来赞助他们
to sponsor them on a monthly basis or one time basis

371
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
这包括得到一半的赞助商或PATREON
this includes a get half sponsors or patreon

372
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,999
除此之外，一些公司还提供
and besides that some companies also offer

373
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,133
资助的百分比，这样的话，你就可以在世界范围内进行开源。
a percentage of the world walking open source so that

374
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:36,466
例如，你可以工作
for example you can work

375
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:39,399
70%在主公司的工作上
70 percent on the maincompany work

376
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:40,333
和30
and 30

377
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,466
开源的
open source one

378
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,933
在一天结束的时候
at the end of day

379
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,933
这对双方都有好处，因为
a benefits both sides where

380
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,133
公司可能
the company may

381
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,533
需要开放源码的专业知识
need the expertise of the open source

382
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:50,299
项目来工作
project to work

383
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,766
在主要公司中也是如此
on the main company as well

384
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,066
但这也是另一条双向的道路
but this is also another 2 way street

385
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,266
帮助每个人
where helps everyone

386
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,066
同时也是一种普遍的服务工作
and also sound the universal work of services

387
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,966
这有点像赞助
which is kind of like sponsorship

388
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,599
但你会得到一些回报
but you get something in return

389
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,566
比如说你需要维护者的支持，你可以得到
say you need support from the maintainers you can get

390
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:05,666
直接帮助他们
direct help on them

391
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:09,299
这也是支持这些项目的另一种方式
which is also another way to support these project

392
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,000
维护者的最终媒体
maintainers the ultimate media

393
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,666
你在笔上使用的项目也得到了维护
project that you use on the pen is also maintained

394
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,199
这也有助于你使用的产品
which also helps with the product that you used

395
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,533
构建在它上面的产品
to build on top of it

396
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:20,066
所以它也会帮助你获得回报
so it will help you in a return as well

397
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:22,933
总结一下上面的内容
to kinda summarize the top

398
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,366
这是我做的一个方便的清单
here's a handy list that I've made

399
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,699
汇编了我们目前所做的每一项工作的要点
compiling every points that we have tasked far

400
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,566
但你可以在未来再次使用参考
but you can use to reference in the future again

401
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,466
最重要的是要有乐趣
and most importantly have fun

402
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,333
项目工作
work on projects

403
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,999
你是否有兴趣把它作为一种心态来做？
are you interested in making it as a heartbeat

404
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,499
不要试图把自己逼得太紧
don't try to push yourself too much

405
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,466
在需要的时候休息一下
and take breaks where needed

406
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,933
不要倦怠，也不要
don't burn out and also

407
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,133
尊重他人，他们也在努力
be respectful to others who are also trying

408
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,599
贡献的人
to contribute to

409
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:50,766
资源的人。
the resource as well

410
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,866
这就是我的全部想法
and that is all for my thought

411
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,166
谢谢你的聆听
thank you for listening

412
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,133
我可以特别感谢在他们的旅程中帮助我的主宰者
and I can give special thanks to the dominating

413
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,966
我可以特别感谢那些在他们的旅程中帮助我的epita和
epita who helped me in their journey and

414
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,333
位的来源，如果没有他们的健康，我
bit source where I've

415
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,066
没有他们的健康，我永远不会有今天的成就
never been where I am today without their health

416
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,333
你可以在我的社交网站上找我
and you could look for me on my socials
